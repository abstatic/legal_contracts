<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6 A. As soon as is administratively feasible after the end of the

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If after the application of subparagraph 1 an excess amount still
exists, and the Member is covered by the Plan at the end of the Limitation
Year, the excess amount in the Member&#146;s account will be used to reduce Company
contributions (including any allocation of forfeitures) for such Member in the
next Limitation Year, and each succeeding Limitation Year if necessary.

Year, the excess amount will be held unallocated in a suspense account. The
suspense account will be applied to reduce future Company contributions
(including allocation of any forfeitures) for all remaining Members in the next
Limitation Year, and each succeeding Limitation Year if necessary.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If a suspense account is in existence at any time during the Limitation

to a Member&#146;s account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not
exceed the maximum annual additions reduced by the annual additions credited to
a Member&#146;s account under the

Company contributions which shall be unvested at the time of his termination of
membership or termination of employment shall be forfeited and shall reduce the
future contributions of the Company or Companies of which such Member was an
Employee. If a Member shall make a complete withdrawal pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1
of his vested interest in the assets of the Plan attributable to his after-tax
contributions and Elective Deferrals, if any, his unvested interests in the
assets of the Plan derived from Company matching contributions attributable to
the contributions withdrawn by the Member shall be forfeited. Forfeitures
shall occur in a similar manner in the case of a complete withdrawal under
Section&nbsp;8.1 of the Member&#146;s account balances attributable to his after-tax
contributions or his after-tax contributions and Elective Deferrals, if any,
but shall apply to the interest of such Member in the assets of the Plan
derived from Company contributions that matched the Member&#146;s contributions to

For the purposes of this Section&nbsp;10.1, assets representing employer
contributions to the HOVENSA Plan which are transferred to the Plan shall be
treated as Company contributions.

restored to their value as of the Valuation Date described in Section&nbsp;8.3 if
such Employee shall, within five years of the date of such withdrawal or
termination, repay to the Plan the full amount of any distribution received by
him upon such withdrawal or termination of membership.

Section&nbsp;9.1 if such Employee shall, within the earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;his

full amount of his distribution to the Retail Operations Plan or the HOVENSA
Plan in accordance with the terms of those plans, such repaid amount and the

Plan and the payment of its contributions hereunder indefinitely; but
continuation of the Plan is not assumed as a contractual obligation of any
Company, and the right is reserved by each Company at any time to reduce,
suspend or discontinue its contributions hereunder, and to terminate its
participation in the Plan in whole or in part. Except in the case of a
termination in operation, the termination by a Company of its participation in
the Plan shall be evidenced by a written instrument executed by the Company
effective as of the date stated therein, and by a certified copy of a duly
enacted resolution of the board of directors of such Company authorizing such
termination. Copies of such instrument and of such resolution shall be
delivered to the Committee and to the Trustee. Participation of a Company in
the Plan may be terminated in operation without formal notice.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. The right is also reserved by the Principal Company to terminate the
Plan. Except in the case of a termination in operation, termination of the
Plan shall be evidenced by a written instrument executed by the Principal
Company effective as of the date stated therein, and by a certified copy of a
duly enacted resolution of the Board of Directors authorizing such termination.
Copies of such instrument and of such resolution shall be delivered to the
Committee and to the Trustee. The Plan may be terminated in operation without
formal notice.

all or a designated group of its Employees, then and in that event, from and

terminating Company or by its Employees, (b)&nbsp;no Employees of such group shall
become Members of the Plan, and (c)&nbsp;no further payments of benefits with
respect to Members of such group shall be made except in distribution of assets

all Company contributions thereto, as above provided, the Committee shall
direct the Trustee to allocate and segregate the portion of the assets of the
Plan held for the benefit of those Members whose membership in the Plan is
being terminated. The Committee may direct the Trustee to continue to hold
such assets, under the Plan, to convert such assets into cash, to distribute
such assets or such cash to such Members, or to transfer such portion, or all
of the assets, as the case may be, to another trust fund for the benefit of the
Members as to whom the Plan is terminated, including, but not limited to, a
fund or trust under another savings plan of the terminating Company or of
another business organization.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. In the event that the termination of any Company&#146;s participation in the
Plan, or the termination of the Plan, or the complete discontinuance of all
Company contributions thereto, shall not be accompanied by a termination of the
Trust, then those assets allocated pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;A of this Section&nbsp;13.4
which, at the direction of the Committee, shall continue to be held by the
Trustee under the Plan, shall be distributed to Members and former Members in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan relating to distribution of
withdrawals and distribution on termination of employment.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. The Committee shall, on termination of the Trust, and may, in its
discretion, on termination of a Company&#146;s participation, termination of the
Plan, or complete discontinuance of all Company contributions thereto, direct
the Trustee to distribute to each Member his interest in the assets of the Plan
then held by the Trustee.

Member&#146;s participation in the Plan shall be deemed terminated if immediately
following the termination of his employer&#146;s participation in the Plan, in whole
or in part, such Member shall be employed by another Company. In such event
the interest of such Member in the Plan shall continue to be held by the
Trustee under the Plan to furnish benefits provided by the Plan.

Member (if either the Plan or the other plan shall then be terminated) shall be
entitled to receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or

had then been terminated.

to a trust under any savings plan adopted or to be adopted by such Successor
Company.

to set aside assets equal in value to that portion of the assets of the Plan
determined pursuant to Paragraph&nbsp;A to be allocable to Members employed by the
Successor Company, and to deliver such assets to a trustee designated by the
Successor Company.

of any benefits under the Plan which shall have accrued to him as of the
effective date of the transfer.

GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.1 All benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid or provided for
solely from the assets of the Plan, and no Company assumes any liability or
responsibility therefor. The obligations of each Company, which are expressly
stated to be noncontractual, are limited solely to the making of contributions
to the Trust Fund, as provided for in the Plan.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.2 In the event that any benefit hereunder becomes payable to a minor,
or to a person under legal disability, or to a person judicially declared
incompetent, then the Committee shall direct the same to be paid out by the
Trustee in such of the following ways as the Committee may deem best:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Directly to such person.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. In the case of a minor, to the guardian or other person having the care
and control of such minor.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. To the legally appointed guardian or conservator of such person.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. To any institution maintaining or having the custody of such person in
accordance with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.3 If at any time any doubt shall exist as to the identity of any person
entitled to payment of any benefit hereunder, or as to the amount or time of
any such payment, or if the Committee is unable to authorize payment of
benefits to any person because his whereabouts cannot be ascertained, the
Committee shall certify such fact to the Trustee, and shall direct the Trustee
to hold the amount of benefit in trust until the Committee&#146;s further order or
until final order of a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a Member
or Beneficiary to whom payment of a benefit under the Plan is due cannot be
located, or has not presented benefit checks for payment within one year after
Plan distributions shall have been made to him, such benefit shall be treated
as having been forfeited, provided that if a claim therefor is subsequently
made by, or on behalf of, such Member or Beneficiary such benefit shall be
reinstated. For the sole purpose of this Section, the term Member or
Beneficiary shall include a former member or beneficiary of the former Amerada
Hess Corporation Employees&#146; Stock Ownership Plan who could not be located by
the former trustee of that plan, and with respect to whom said trustee
transferred unpaid amounts to the Plan.

payable hereunder may be paid by the Trustee directly or through an agent,
including the Committee or one of its agents.

to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
charge, garnishment, execution, or levy of any kind, either voluntary or
involuntary, prior to actually being received by the person entitled to the
benefit under the terms of the Plan except in the case of a qualified domestic
relations order as defined in Code Section&nbsp;414(p), or in the case of an offset
of a Member&#146;s benefits against an amount that the Member is ordered or required
to pay to the Plan as described in Code Section&nbsp;401(a)(13)(C), if (i)&nbsp;the order
or requirement to pay arises (A)&nbsp;under a judgment of conviction for a crime
involving such Plan, (B)&nbsp;under a civil judgment (including a consent order or
decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation
(or alleged violation) of part 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, or (C)
pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary of Labor and the
participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of
such subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person, and (ii)&nbsp;the judgment, order,
decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or
part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the Plan against the
Member&#146;s benefits provided under the Plan; and any attempt to anticipate,
alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose
of any right to benefits payable hereunder, except in the case of a qualified
domestic relations order or in accordance with Code Section&nbsp;401(a)(13)(C) shall
be void. In the case of a qualified domestic relations order, the portion of
the participant&#146;s interest in the Plan designated for the benefit of the
alternate payee shall be distributed to such alternate payee as soon as
practicable after the qualification of the order. If a portion of the
alternate payee&#146;s interest in the Plan is derived from Company contributions or
employer matching contributions made to the HOVENSA Plan in which the
participant is not vested, such portion shall not be distributed to the
alternate payee, but shall be retained in the alternate payee&#146;s Plan account
until vested or forfeited, based on the status of the participant.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, partial withdrawals, hardship
withdrawals, loans and rollovers from other plans or from rollover individual
retirement accounts shall not be
available to an alternate payee. The Committee shall establish reasonable
procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and
to administer distributions under such qualified orders.

TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.1 If the Plan is or becomes top-heavy in any Plan year beginning after
December&nbsp;31, 1983, the provisions of Sections&nbsp;18.2 through 18.6 will supersede
any conflicting provision in the Plan.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.2 Definitions:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. 1. Key Employee: Any Employee or former employee (and the
Beneficiaries of such Employee) who at any time during the determination period
was an officer of the Company, if such individual&#146;s annual compensation exceeds
50&nbsp;percent of the dollar limitation under Code Section&nbsp;415(c)(1)(A), an owner
(or considered an owner under Code Section&nbsp;318) of one of the ten largest
interests in the Company if such individual&#146;s compensation exceeds 100&nbsp;percent
of such dollar limitation, a 5-percent owner of the Company, or a 1-percent
owner of the Company who has an annual compensation of more than $150,000. The
determination period is the Plan Year containing the determination date and the
4 preceding Plan years. The determination of who is a key employee will be
made in accordance with Code Section&nbsp;416(i)(1) and the regulations thereunder.
For these purposes, (i)&nbsp;no more than 50 Employees (or, if less, the greater of
3 or 10&nbsp;percent of the Employees) shall be treated as officers, and (ii), if 2
Employees have the same interest in the Company, the Employee having greater
annual compensation from the Company shall be treated as having a larger
interest.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Solely for the purpose of determining if the Plan, or any other plan
included in a required aggregation group of which this Plan is a part, is
top-heavy (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;416(g) of the Code) the accrued
benefit of an Employee other than a key employee (within the meaning of Section
416(i)(1) of the Code) shall be determined under (a)&nbsp;the method, if any, that
uniformly applies for accrual purposes under all plans maintained by the
Affiliated Companies, or (b)&nbsp;if there is no such method, as if such benefit
accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the
fractional accrual rate of Section&nbsp;411(b)(1)(C) of the Code.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Top-heavy plan: For any Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 1983,
this Plan is top-heavy if any of the following conditions exists:
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If the top-heavy ratio for this Plan exceeds 60&nbsp;percent and this Plan
is not part of any required aggregation group or permissive aggregation group
of plans.

plans exceeds 60&nbsp;percent.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If this Plan is a part of a required aggregation group and part of a
permissive aggregation group of plans and the top-heavy ratio for the
permissive aggregation group exceeds 60&nbsp;percent.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Top-heavy ratio:
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The top-heavy ratio shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the
sum of account balances under all defined contribution plans of the Company for
all key employees and the present value of accrued benefits under all defined
benefit plans of the Company for all key employees as of the determination
date, and the denominator of which is the sum of the account balances under the
defined contribution plans for all Members and the present value of accrued
benefits under the defined benefit plans for all Members as of the
determination date. Both the numerator and denominator of the top-heavy ratio
shall be adjusted for any distribution of an account balance or an accrued
benefit made in the five-year period ending on the determination date and any
contribution due but unpaid as of the determination date.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. For purposes of subparagraph 1 above, the value of account balances and
the present value of accrued benefits will be determined as of the most recent
valuation date that falls within or ends with the 12-month period ending on the
determination date. The account balances and accrued benefits of a Member (i)
who is not a key employee but who was a key employee in a prior year or (ii)
who has not received any compensation from any Company maintaining the Plan at
any time during the 5-year period ending on the determination date will be
disregarded. The calculation of the top-heavy ratio, and the extent to which
distributions, rollovers, and transfers are taken into account will be made in
accordance with Code Section&nbsp;416 and the regulations thereunder. Deductible
employee contributions will not be taken into account for purposes of computing
the top-heavy ratio. When aggregating plans the value of account balances and
accrued benefits will be calculated with reference to the determination dates
that fall within the same calendar year.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Permissive aggregation group: The required aggregation group of plans
plus any other plan or plans of the Company which, when considered as a group
with the
required aggregation group, would continue to satisfy the requirements of
Sections&nbsp;401(a)(4) and 410 of the Code.

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. Present value: For purposes of establishing present value to compute
the top-heavy ratio, any benefit shall be discounted only for mortality and

and December&nbsp;31 of each year for all defined contribution plans.

</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs C and D below, the
Company contributions and forfeitures allocated on behalf of any Member who is
not a key employee shall not be less than the lesser of three percent of such
Member&#146;s Compensation or in the case where the Company&#146;s defined benefit plan
does not designate this Plan to satisfy Section&nbsp;401 of the Code, the largest
percentage of Company and Member contributions and forfeitures as a percentage
of the key employees&#146; Compensation, as limited by Section&nbsp;401(a)(17) of the
Code, allocated on behalf of any key employee for that year. The minimum
allocation is determined without regard to any Social Security contribution.
This minimum allocation shall be made even though, under other Plan provisions,
the Member would not otherwise be entitled to receive an allocation, or would
have received a lesser allocation in the year because of (i)&nbsp;the Member&#146;s
failure to complete 1,000 hours of Service (or any equivalent provided in the
Plan), or (ii)&nbsp;the Member&#146;s failure to make Member contributions to the Plan,
or (iii)
Compensation less than a stated amount.

purposes of determining benefits under the Plan, except that for Plan Years

balance attributable to Company contributions shall be at least as favorable as
the following:

of Section&nbsp;411(a)(7) of the Code except those attributable to Employee
contributions, including benefits accrued before the effective date of Section
416 and benefits accrued before the Plan became top-heavy. Further, no
reduction in vested benefits may occur in
the event the Plan&#146;s status as top-heavy changes for any Plan Year. However,
this Section does not apply to the account balances of any Employee who does
not have an hour of Service after the Plan has initially become top-heavy, and
such Employee&#146;s account balance attributable to Company contributions and
forfeitures will be determined without regard to this Section.

less frequently than monthly, over a period not extending beyond five years
from the date of the loan, unless such loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit
which within a reasonable time (determined as the time the loan is made) will
be used as the principal residence of the Member. An assignment or pledge of
any portion of the Member&#146;s interest in the Plan and a loan, pledge, or
assignment with respect to any insurance contract purchased under the Plan,
will be treated as a loan under this paragraph.
