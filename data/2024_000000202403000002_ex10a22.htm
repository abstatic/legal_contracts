construction manager, any request by Tenant for approval of the Work or for the execution of<br>
certain instruments as contemplated by Sections 5.2 and 5.3 below shall be in writing<br>

Upon expiration of the Term or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant (or its sublessees or<br>

Landlord, the Property and all Improvements by adequate surety bond or other appropriate<br>
means reasonably satisfactory to Landlord.  This right shall not be deemed or construed in any<br>
way as relieving or modifying Tenant's covenants to pay any such Tax or obligation imposed by<br>
a lien at the time and in the manner provided in this Article.  Landlord shall, upon written request<br>
and at Tenant's sole cost and expense, join in any such proceedings, if Tenant determines that it<br>
shall be necessary or appropriate for Landlord to do so in order for Tenant to properly prosecute<br>
such proceedings.  Tenant hereby agrees to indemnify and defend Landlord from any costs,<br>
expenses, and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from<br>
any such proceeding.  In the event that Landlord joins in any such proceedings, absent a request<br>
by Tenant to so join, Landlord shall be solely responsible for any and all of Landlord's costs and<br>

cancelled or amended or its coverage reduced except upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice<br>
by certified or registered mail to each of the insureds.  Landlord and Tenant shall not obtain or<br>
carry separate insurance concurrent in form or contributing, in the event of loss, with that<br>
required by this Section unless the other is an additional insured therein.  Landlord or Tenant, as<br>
applicable, shall immediately notify the other whenever any such separate insurance is obtained<br>

the receipt of such request.  The Leasehold Mortgage shall provide that if the Leasehold<br>
Mortgagee does not respond to any such request within such thirty (30) day period, the request<br>
shall be deemed automatically approved and the Leasehold Mortgagee shall be bound thereby.<BR>

</B><U><B>Rights and Obligations of Leasehold Mortgagees</B></U><B>.</B>  If Tenant shall mortgage its<br>
leasehold interest hereunder, or any portion thereof, in accordance with the provisions of this<br>
Article, then, as long as any such Leasehold Mortgage shall remain unsatisfied of record and<br>
Landlord has received the notice specified in paragraph&nbsp;(c) of Section&nbsp;13.1 above, the following<br>
provisions shall apply:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Leasehold Mortgagee shall register with Landlord its name and<br>
address in writing, no Event of Default shall be grounds for the termination of this Lease by<br>
Landlord unless and until (i)&nbsp;a notice thereof has been concurrently mailed to Tenant and to the<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee at their respective addresses registered with Landlord (the &quot;Notice of<br>
Default&quot;) and (ii) the cure period set forth in paragraph (b) next below has expired without cure<br>
having been completed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Tenant shall be in default hereunder, the Leasehold<br>
Mortgagee shall, within the period and otherwise as herein provided, have the right (but not the<br>
obligation) to remedy such default, or cause the same to be remedied; and Landlord shall accept<br>
such performance by or at the instigation of such Leasehold Mortgagee as if the same had been<br>
done by Tenant.  The Leasehold Mortgagee shall have thirty (30) days more than the period<br>
provided Tenant under this Lease after Landlord's delivery of the Notice of Default for curing<br>
the default or causing the same to be cured.  Such additional thirty-day period shall be extended<br>
if (i)&nbsp;the default is other than the payment of money and such that it is not practicable to cure<br>
within such additional thirty-day period and (ii)&nbsp;the Leasehold Mortgagee diligently prosecutes<br>
such cure to completion.  Tenant hereby constitutes and appoints the Leasehold Mortgagee as<br>
Tenant's agent and attorney-in-fact with full power, in Tenant's name, place and stead, and at<br>
Tenant's sole cost and expense, to enter upon the Property and the Improvements and to perform<br>
all acts required to be performed herein or in any sublease made hereunder by Tenant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While any such Leasehold Mortgage remains unsatisfied of record, and an<br>
event or events shall occur which shall entitle Landlord to terminate this Lease, the Leasehold<br>
Mortgagee shall have the right to acquire all of Tenant's right under this Lease, provided such<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee shall:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before the expiration of thirty (30) days after the date of service of<br>
a notice of termination under this Lease (but in no event prior to the last day on which the<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee is entitled to cure such default as provided in subparagraph (b)<br>
above), promptly cure all defaults which may be cured by the payment of a sum of<br>
money and undertake to cure any other existing default of Tenant;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to pay the rent and all other amounts payable by Tenant<br>
under this Lease;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promptly thereafter initiate and diligently pursue steps to acquire<br>
Tenant's interest in this Lease by foreclosure of its Leasehold Mortgage or otherwise; and<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promptly execute all documents reasonably requested by Landlord<br>
effecting the transaction contemplated by this Section and this Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of the termination of this Lease prior to the natural expiration<br>
of the Term due to default of Tenant or operation of law (including the bankruptcy of Tenant),<br>
Landlord shall notify the Leasehold Mortgagee (of which Landlord has been notified pursuant to<br>
this Section) of such termination pursuant to the notice provisions of this Lease, and deliver to<br>
such Leasehold Mortgagee a statement of any and all sums which would at that time be due<br>
under this Lease then known to Landlord.  Subject to the provisions of this Article, such<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee shall thereupon have the right to obtain a new lease in accordance with<br>
subsections (i)&nbsp;through (iii) below; provided, however, and notwithstanding the foregoing to the<br>
contrary, if, at the time of an Event of Default arising under Article&nbsp;XIV below, this Lease would<br>
otherwise terminate by reason of a rejection of this Lease by Tenant or Tenant's trustee in<br>
bankruptcy, and Landlord shall also be in bankruptcy or a petition in bankruptcy shall have been<br>
filed by or against Landlord, then simultaneously with the rejection of this Lease by Tenant, such&nbsp;<br>
easehold Mortgagee shall become the new tenant under this Lease such that this Lease shall<br>
neither terminate nor lapse by reason of the change of tenants; and provided further, however,&nbsp;<br>
hat in the event such Leasehold Mortgagee shall so become the new tenant hereunder, such<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee shall, within ten (10) days after so becoming the new tenant, have the right<br>
to terminate this Lease, in which event, such Leasehold Mortgagee shall have no liability to<br>
Landlord except for liability accruing during such tenancy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the written request of the Leasehold Mortgagee within thirty<br>
(30) days after service of the notice of termination, Landlord shall enter into a new lease<br>
of the Property and the Improvements with such Leasehold Mortgagee, or its designee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such new lease shall be effective as of the date of termination of<br>
this Lease and shall be for the remainder of the Term, at the rent and upon the terms,<br>
covenants and conditions contained in this Lease.  Upon the execution of such new lease,<br>
and subject to this Section, the Leasehold Mortgagee shall pay any and all sums which<br>
would, at the time of the execution thereof, be due under this Lease but for such<br>
termination and shall pay all expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable<br>
attorneys' fees, court costs and disbursements) incurred by Landlord in connection with<br>
such default and termination, the recovery of possession of the Property and the<br>
preparation, execution and delivery of such new lease; provided, however, that with<br>
respect to any default which cannot be cured by such Leasehold Mortgagee until it<br>
obtains possession, such Leasehold Mortgagee shall have a reasonable time after it<br>
obtains possession to cure such default.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If before the execution of such new lease, Landlord has<br>
encumbered its fee interest in the Property with a deed of trust and the terms of the deed<br>
of trust do not obligate the beneficiary thereof to not disturb the quiet possession of the<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee who is the tenant under such new lease, then Landlord shall obtain<br>
from such beneficiary a nondisturbance agreement pursuant to which such beneficiary<br>
agrees not to disturb such Leasehold Mortgagee's quiet possession of the Property so<br>
long as such Leasehold Mortgagee is not in default under the new lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any payment to be made or action to be taken by a Leasehold Mortgagee<br>
hereunder as a prerequisite to keeping this Lease in effect shall be deemed properly to have been<br>
made or taken by the Leasehold Mortgagee if such payment is made.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord and Tenant shall each give the Leasehold Mortgagee notice of<br>
any condemnation proceedings affecting the Property or any Improvements thereon.  The<br>
Leasehold Mortgagee shall have the right to intervene and be made a party to any such<br>
condemnation proceedings; and Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that the Leasehold Mortgagee<br>
may be made such a party or intervenor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Leasehold Mortgagee, nor any owner of the leasehold estate hereunder<br>
whose interest shall have been acquired by, through or under any Leasehold Mortgage or shall<br>
have been derived immediately from any holder thereof, shall become personally liable under the<br>
provisions of this Lease, unless and until such time as the Leasehold Mortgagee or such owner<br>
becomes the owner of such leasehold estate and then only for as long as it remains the owner<br>
thereof.  Upon any permitted assignment of this Lease by a Leasehold Mortgagee or any owner<br>
of the leasehold estate hereunder whose interest shall have been acquired by, through or under<br>
any Leasehold Mortgage or shall have been derived immediately from any holder thereof, the<br>
assignor shall be relieved of any further liability which may accrue hereunder from and after the<br>
date of such assignment, provided that the assignee shall execute and deliver to Landlord a<br>
recordable instrument of assumption wherein such assignee shall assume the rights and<br>
obligations of Tenant and agree to perform and observe all provisions of this Lease as they are<br>
applicable to Tenant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rights granted herein to Leasehold Mortgagees shall be enforceable by<br>
them.  In the event any action or proceeding is brought to enforce or interpret the provisions<br>
hereof or to seek damages or performance or to declare the rights of the parties hereto or of any<br>
such Leasehold Mortgagee, the prevailing party (including such Leasehold Mortgagee, if<br>
prevailing) shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'<br>
fees) incurred therein.<BR>

(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At such time as a Leasehold Mortgage shall be satisfied, the Leasehold<br>
Mortgagee shall cooperate with Tenant in providing to Tenant and/or Landlord all<br>
documentation necessary to release any and all liens with respect thereto.  <BR>

</B><U><B>Cooperation for Leasehold Mortgagee</B></U><B>.</B>  Landlord and Tenant shall cooperate by<br>
including in this Lease by suitable amendment from time to time any provision which may<br>
reasonably be requested by any proposed Leasehold Mortgagee for the purpose of implementing<br>
the mortgagee protection provisions contained in this Lease and allowing such Leasehold<br>
Mortgagee reasonable means to protect and preserve the lien of the Leasehold Mortgage on the<br>
occurrence of a default under this Lease.  Landlord and Tenant each agree to execute and deliver<br>
(and to acknowledge, if necessary, for recording purposes) any agreement necessary to effect any<br>
such amendment; provided, however, that any such amendment shall not in any way affect the<br>
Term or any payments due under this Lease nor otherwise in any other material respect adversely<br>
affect any rights of Landlord under this Lease.  <BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure to pay any rent or any other sum payable by Tenant to<br>
Landlord on any date upon which the same is due; or<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The failure to keep or perform any of the provisions of this Lease which<br>
are to be kept or performed by Tenant.<BR>

</B><U><B>Notice of Tenant's Default</B></U><B>.</B>  Tenant shall not be considered in default under this<br>
Lease unless the default is non-curable, or in the event of a curable default, unless (i)&nbsp;Landlord<br>
shall give notice specifying the default to Tenant, and (ii)&nbsp;Tenant has failed to cure within the<br>
applicable cure period.  Tenant shall have, after the date of receipt of a notice of default, ten (10)<br>
days to cure any Event of Default under Section&nbsp;14.1(a) and thirty (30) days to cure any Event of<br>
Default under Section&nbsp;14.1(b); provided, however, that Tenant shall not be in default under this<br>
Lease with respect to any Event of Default under Section&nbsp;14.1(b) if the default is of a nature<br>
which is not reasonably curable within the applicable cure period and Tenant has undertaken<br>
action to cure within such period and diligently proceeds with such action to cure.  In the event<br>
Tenant is determined to be in default under this Lease, Landlord may either terminate this Lease<br>
and/or pursue damages and/or any other remedy available to Landlord by reason of such default<br>
(rights of termination and all other remedies and damages being cumulative and not exclusive).  <BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of any default by Tenant and expiration of all applicable cure<br>
periods therefor hereunder, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in<br>
equity, Landlord shall have the option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder.<br>
If Landlord elects to so terminate this Lease, then Landlord may recover from Tenant:<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid<br>
rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the<br>
amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid<br>
rent of the balance for the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental<br>
loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided.<BR>
<BR>
The &quot;worth at the time of award&quot; of the amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be&nbsp;<br>
omputed by allowing interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per year.  The worth at the time of<br>
award of the amount referred to in clause (iii) above shall be computed by discounting such<br>
amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award<br>
plus one percent (1%).<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to all other rights of Landlord pursuant to this Lease, at law or<br>
in equity, Landlord shall have all rights set forth in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (which<br>
provides a lessor may continue the lease in effect after a lessee's breach and abandonment and<br>
recover rent as it becomes due if lessee has right to sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable<br>

relief which may be provided by law, whether or not stated in this Lease.<BR>

constitute a waiver of any obligation, requirement or covenant required to be performed by the<br>
other party hereunder.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease, any failures or<br>
delays by either party in asserting any rights and remedies as to any default shall not operate as a<br>
waiver of any default or of any such rights or remedies.  Delays by either party in asserting any<br>
of its rights and remedies shall not deprive either party of the right to institute and maintain any<br>
actions or proceedings which it may deem necessary to protect, assert or enforce any such rights<br>
or remedies.<BR>

to Landlord specifying the nature of such default; provided, however, that if the nature of<br>
Landlord's obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for its performance,<br>

such thirty (30) day period and thereafter shall diligently prosecute the same to completion.<BR>

increments<br>
of Two Hundred Ten Thousand Dollars ($210,000) per month.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such annual Base Rent for the period after the Break Date shall be adjusted effective as<br>
of each Adjustment Date.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The annual Base Rent effective as of each Adjustment Date shall be determined by<br>
multiplying the initial annual Base Rent of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars<br>
($2,500,000) by a fraction the denominator of which  shall be the Base CPI and the numerator of<br>
which is the most recently published CPI prior to the Adjustment Date in question.  Landlord<br>
shall provide the calculations of the adjustment in the annual Base Rent and monthly Base Rent<br>
along with reasonable backup information relating thereto to Tenant as soon as possible.  If&nbsp;<br>
Tenant has not received the calculation of the adjusted annual Base Rent at least fifteen (15) days<br>
prior to the Adjustment Date, Tenant shall continue to pay monthly Base Rent in the amount in<br>
effect immediately prior to such Adjustment Date.  In such event and within fifteen (15) days<br>
after receipt of Landlord's calculation for the adjustment in Base Rent and any reasonable<br>
backup information, Tenant shall pay the difference between the adjusted monthly Base Rent and<br>
the monthly Base Rent paid to Landlord for those months which should have been previously<br>
adjusted.<BR>
