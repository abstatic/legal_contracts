Landlord hereby leases, demises and lets to Tenant and Tenant<br>
hereby takes and leases from Landlord for the Term or terms and upon the provisions hereinafter<br>
specified the following described property (collectively, the &quot;Premises&quot;):  (i) the premises<br>
described in <U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> attached hereto and made a part hereof together with the easements, rights<br>
and appurtenances thereunto belonging or appertaining (collectively, the &quot;Land&quot;); (ii) the<br>
buildings, structures, fixtures and other improvements constructed and to be constructed on the<br>
Land (collectively, the &quot;Improvements&quot;), together with Landlord's Trade Fixtures, all Alterations<br>
and other additions and accessions thereto, substitutions therefor and replacements thereof<br>
permitted by this Lease.  Pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;10.3</U> of the CC&amp;R's, this Lease is subject to, and<br>
Tenant shall comply with the provisions of, the Project Documents (as defined in the CC&amp;R's),<br>
which provisions are an integral part of this Lease.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Term</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall have and hold the Premises for a term commencing on the date<br>
hereof (the &quot;Commencement Date&quot;) and ending upon the date which is the last day of the
twenty-<br>
seventh (27th) month after the Commencement Date (the &quot;Expiration Date&quot;).  Notwithstanding<br>
the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease, effective upon the date which is<br>
the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month after the Commencement Date, or which is the last day<br>
of any succeeding month through the twenty-sixth (26th) month after the Commencement Date,<br>
upon delivery of at least four (4) months' prior written notice to Landlord of Tenant's intention<br>
to terminate this Lease.  Landlord shall have the right (i) to advertise the availability of the<br>
Premises for sale or for reletting, and to erect upon the Premises signs indicating such availability<br>
(provided that such signs do not unreasonably interfere with the use of the Premises by Tenant),<br>
and (ii) to show the Premises to prospective purchasers or tenants at reasonable times during<br>
normal business hours upon reasonable notice to Tenant.  Provided Tenant is not in default under<br>
this Lease, if (a) Tenant has delivered to Landlord four (4) months' written notice of Tenant's<br>
intention to terminate this Lease effective upon a date which is prior to the last day of the<br>
eighteenth (18th) month after the Commencement Date, (b) Tenant has vacated the Premises in<br>
accordance with the provisions of this Lease on or prior to the termination date set forth in such<br>
termination notice, and (c) Landlord has entered into a new lease with a new tenant for the<br>
Premises with a rent commencement date prior to the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month<br>
after the Commencement Date (provided that nothing in this Paragraph 3 shall obligate Landlord<br>
to obtain a new lease or tenant), then this Lease shall terminate upon the rent commencement<br>
date of the new lease.  If the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, Tenant shall remain obligated<br>
to pay rent through the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month after the Commencement Date.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall pay to Landlord or Lender, if directed by Landlord, as annual<br>
rent for the Premises during the Term, the amount of One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand<br>
and No/100 Dollars ($1,250,000.00) (&quot;Basic Rent&quot;), subject to adjustment as set forth below,<br>
which rent shall be paid in advance in equal monthly installments of One Hundred Four<br>
Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Six and 66/100 Dollars ($104,166.66) commencing on the<br>
Commencement Date and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter during the Term<br>
(the said days being called the &quot;Basic Rent Payment Dates&quot;), and shall pay the same at<br>
Landlord's address set forth below, or at such other place or to such other person or persons and<br>
in such proportions as Landlord from time to time may designate to Tenant in writing, in funds<br>
which at the time of such payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public or private debts<br>
in the United States of America and if required by Lender by wire transfer in immediately<br>
available federal funds to such account in such bank as Lender shall designate from time to time.<br>
Pro rata Basic Rent for the period from the Commencement Date to the first day of the month<br>
next following the Commencement Date shall be paid in advance on the Commencement Date.<br>
In addition, if Tenant fails to make any payment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent to Landlord on<br>
the date due, Tenant shall pay a late charge equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount past due.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any installment of Basic Rent or Additional Rent is not paid on the date<br>
due, Tenant shall pay to the party entitled to receive such installment interest on such overdue<br>
payment at the Default Rate, accruing from the due date of such payment until the same is paid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall pay and discharge before the imposition of any fine, lien,<br>
interest or penalty may be added thereto for late payment thereof, as Additional Rent, all other<br>
amounts and obligations which Tenant assumes or agrees to pay or discharge pursuant to this<br>
Lease, together with every fine, penalty, interest and cost which may be added by the party to<br>
whom such payment is due for nonpayment or late payment thereof.  In the event of any failure<br>
by Tenant to pay or discharge any of the foregoing, Landlord and Lender shall have all rights,<br>
powers and remedies provided herein, by law or otherwise, in the event of nonpayment of Basic<br>
Rent.  Any Additional Rent payable to Landlord shall be paid to the party to whom Basic Rent is<br>
to be paid.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the intention of the parties hereto that the obligations of Tenant<br>
hereunder shall be separate and independent covenants and agreements, and that Basic Rent,<br>
Additional Rent and all other sums payable by Tenant hereunder shall continue to be payable in<br>
all events, and that the obligations of Tenant hereunder shall continue unaffected, unless the<br>
requirement to pay or perform the same shall have been terminated pursuant to an express<br>
provision of this Lease.  This is a net Lease and Basic Rent, Additional Rent and all other sums<br>
payable hereunder by Tenant shall be paid without notice or demand, and without setoff,<br>
counterclaim, recoupment, abatement, suspension, deferment, diminution, deduction, reduction<br>
or defense, except as otherwise specifically set forth herein.  This Lease shall not terminate and<br>
Tenant shall not have any right to terminate this Lease during the Term (except as otherwise<br>
expressly provided herein).  Tenant agrees that, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it<br>
shall not take any action to terminate, rescind or void this Lease notwithstanding
(i) the<br>
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution,<br>
winding-up or other proceeding affecting Landlord, (ii) the exercise of any remedy, including<br>
foreclosure, under the Mortgage, (iii) any action with respect to this Lease (including the<br>
disaffirmance hereof) which may be taken by Landlord under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or by<br>
any trustee, receiver or liquidator of Landlord or by any court under the Federal Bankruptcy Code<br>
or otherwise, (iv) the Taking of the Premises or any portion thereof (except as specifically<br>
provided in <U>Paragraph 12(b)</U> below), (v) the prohibition or restriction of Tenant's use of the<br>
Premises under any Legal Requirement or otherwise, (vi) the destruction of the Premises or any<br>
portion thereof, (vii) the eviction of Tenant from possession of the Premises, by paramount title<br>
or otherwise, or (viii) default by Landlord hereunder or under any other agreement between<br>
Landlord and Tenant.  All costs, expenses and obligations of every kind and nature whatsoever<br>
relating to the Premises and the appurtenances thereto and the use and occupancy thereof which<br>
may arise or become due and payable with respect to the period which ends on the expiration or<br>
earlier termination of the Lease Term in accordance with the provisions hereof (whether or not<br>
the same shall become payable during the Lease Term or thereafter) shall be paid by Tenant.  It is<br>
the purpose and intention of the parties to this Lease that the Basic Rent due hereunder shall be<br>
absolutely net to Landlord and that this Lease shall yield, net to Landlord, the Basic Rent<br>
provided in this Lease.  Tenant waives all rights which are not expressly stated herein, but which<br>
may now or hereafter otherwise be conferred by law to quit, terminate or surrender this Lease or<br>
any of the Premises, to any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, abatement, suspension, deferment,<br>
diminution, deduction, reduction or defense of or to Basic Rent, Additional Rent or any other<br>
sums payable under this Lease, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and for any<br>
statutory lien or offset right against Landlord or its property.<BR>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord and Tenant agree that this Lease is a true lease and does not<br>
represent a financing arrangement.  Each party shall reflect the transaction represented hereby in<br>
all applicable books, records and reports (including income tax filings) in a manner consistent<br>
with &quot;true lease&quot; treatment rather than &quot;financing&quot; treatment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall pay directly to the proper authorities charged with the<br>
collection thereof all charges for water, sewer, gas, oil, electricity, telephone and other utilities or<br>
services used or consumed on the Premises during the Term, whether designated as a charge, tax,<br>
assessment, fee or otherwise, including, without limitation, water and sewer use charges and<br>
taxes, if any, all such charges to be paid as the same from time to time become due.  It is<br>
understood and agreed that Tenant shall make its own arrangements for the installation or<br>
provision of all such utilities and that Landlord shall be under no obligation to furnish any<br>
utilities to the Premises and shall not be liable for any interruption or failure in the supply of any<br>
such utilities to the Premises.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Premises are demised and let subject to the Permitted Encumbrances<br>
and all Legal Requirements and Insurance Requirements, including any existing violation of any<br>
thereof, without representation or warranty by Landlord; it being understood and agreed,<br>
however, that the recital of the Permitted Encumbrances herein shall not be construed as a revival<br>
of any thereof which for any reason may have expired.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without limiting the effect of Landlord's covenant set forth in<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;8(c)</U>, the Landlord makes no, and expressly hereby denies any, representations or<br>
warranties regarding the condition or suitability of, or title to, the Premises.  Tenant agrees that it<br>
takes the Premises &quot;<U>as is</U>,&quot; without any such representation or warranty.  The Premises are leased<br>
to Tenant in their present condition without representation or warranty by Landlord and subject<br>
to the rights of parties in possession, to the existing state of title and any state of facts which an<br>
accurate survey or physical inspection might reveal, to all applicable Legal Requirements now or<br>
hereafter in effect and subject to the Permitted Encumbrances.  Tenant has examined the<br>
Premises and title to the Premises and has found all of the same satisfactory for all purposes.<br>
Tenant acknowledges that immediately prior to this Lease it owned and occupied the Premises<br>
and that Tenant is fully familiar with the physical condition of the Premises and that Landlord<br>
makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to same.  THE LEASE OF<br>
THE PREMISES IS ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, IT BEING AGREED THAT TENANT WILL<br>
LEASE THE PREMISES IN ITS PRESENT CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS.<br>
LANDLORD HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE RELATIVE TO THE PREMISES OR ANY COMPONENT PART THEREOF.<br>
Tenant acknowledges and agrees that no representations or warranties have been made by<br>
Landlord, or by any person, firm or agent acting or purporting to act on behalf of Landlord, as to<br>
(i) the presence or absence on or in the Premises of any particular materials or substances<br>
(including, without limitation, asbestos, hydrocarbons or hazardous or toxic substances), (ii) the<br>
condition or repair of the Premises or any portion thereof, (iii) the value, expense of operation or<br>
income potential of the Premises, (iv) the accuracy or completeness of any title, survey, structural<br>
report, environmental audit or other information provided to Tenant by any third party contractor<br>
relative to the Premises (regardless of whether the same were retained or paid for by Landlord),<br>
or (v) any other fact or condition which has affected or might affect the Premises or the<br>
condition, repair, value, expense of operation or income potential thereof.  Tenant represents that<br>
the officers of Tenant are knowledgeable and experienced in the leasing of properties comparable<br>
to the Premises and agrees that Tenant will be relying solely on Tenant's inspections of the<br>
Premises in leasing the Premises.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH HAVE BEEN<br>
NEGOTIATED AND ARE INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE EXCLUSION AND<br>
NEGATION BY THE LANDLORD OF, AND THE LANDLORD DOES HEREBY<br>
DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES BY THE LANDLORD, EXPRESS OR<br>
IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PREMISES OR ANY PORTION THEREOF,<br>
WHETHER ARISING PURSUANT TO THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY<br>
OTHER LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT OR OTHERWISE, AND TENANT<br>
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS SUCH EXCLUSION, NEGATION AND<br>
DISCLAIMER.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord hereby conditionally assigns, without recourse or warranty<br>
whatsoever, to Tenant, all warranties, guaranties and indemnities, express or implied, and similar<br>
rights which Landlord may have against any manufacturer, seller, engineer, contractor or builder<br>
in respect of any of the Premises, including, but not limited to, any rights and remedies existing<br>
under contract or pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code (collectively, the &quot;guaranties&quot;).<br>
Such assignment shall remain in effect so long as no Event of Default exists hereunder or until<br>
the termination of this Lease.  Landlord shall also retain the right to enforce any guaranties so<br>
assigned in the name of Tenant upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  Landlord hereby<br>
agrees to execute and deliver at Tenant's sole cost and expense such further documents,<br>
including powers of attorney, as Tenant may reasonably request (and which in the good faith<br>
judgment of Landlord, do not adversely affect a substantial general interest of Landlord), in order<br>
that Tenant may have the full benefit of the assignment effected or intended to be effected by this<br>
<U>Paragraph&nbsp;6</U>.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or termination of this Lease, the<br>
guaranties shall automatically revert to Landlord.  The foregoing provision of reversion shall be<br>
self-operative and no further instrument of reassignment shall be required.  In confirmation of<br>
such reassignment Tenant shall execute and deliver promptly any certificate or other instrument<br>
which Landlord may request at Tenant's sole cost and expense.  Any monies collected by Tenant<br>
under any of the guaranties after the occurrence of and during the continuation of an Event of<br>
Default shall be held in trust by Tenant and promptly paid over to Landlord.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord agrees to enter into with Tenant, at Tenant's expense, such<br>
easements, covenants, waivers, approvals or restrictions for utilities, parking or other matters as<br>
desirable for operation of the Premises or properties adjacent thereto (collectively, &quot;Easements&quot;)<br>
as requested by Tenant, subject to Lender's and Landlord's approval thereof, not to be<br>
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no such Easement shall result in any<br>
diminution in the value or utility of the Premises for its legal use and further provided that no<br>
such Easement shall render the use of the Premises dependent upon any other property or<br>
condition the use of the Premises upon the use of any other property or require payment or<br>
performance by Landlord at any time, each of which Tenant shall certify to Landlord and Lender<br>
in writing delivered with Tenant's request with respect to such Easement.  Tenant's request shall<br>
also include Tenant's written undertaking acknowledging that Tenant shall remain liable<br>
hereunder as a principal and not merely as a surety or guarantor notwithstanding the<br>
establishment of any Easement.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Encroachments</U>.  In the event that any Improvement now or hereafter<br>
constructed shall (i) encroach upon any property, street or right-of-way on or adjoining the<br>
Premises, (ii) violate the provisions of any restrictive covenant affecting the Premises, (iii) hinder<br>
or obstruct any easement or right-of-way to which the Premises is subject, or (iv) impair the<br>
rights of others in, to or under any of the foregoing, then, promptly after written request of<br>
Landlord, Tenant shall at Tenant's sole cost and expense either (x) obtain valid and effective<br>
waivers or settlements of all claims, liabilities and damages at Tenant's sole cost and expense<br>
resulting from each such encroachment, violation, hindrance, obstruction or impairment, whether<br>
the same shall affect Landlord, Tenant or both, or (y) take such action as shall be necessary to<br>
remove such encroachment, hindrance or obstruction and to end such violation or impairment.  If<br>
such action is in the form of an Alteration, such Alteration shall conform to the provisions of<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;11</U>.<BR>

otherwise provided in this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;7(a)</U>, Tenant shall, before delinquency thereof, pay and<br>
discharge the following whether the same became due and payable before, on or after the<br>
Commencement Date (collectively, the &quot;Impositions&quot;):  all taxes (including sales, use, and gross<br>
rental taxes), assessments, levies, fees, water and sewer rents and charges, utilities and<br>
communications taxes and charges and all other governmental charges, general and special,<br>
ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen, which are, at any time, prior to or during the<br>
Term, imposed upon or assessed against (i) the Premises, (ii) any Basic Rent, Additional Rent or<br>
other sum payable hereunder, (iii) this Lease, the leasehold estate created hereby, (iv) Landlord,<br>
Lender, or Tenant, as a result of or arising out of the ownership, acquisition, occupancy, leasing,<br>
use, maintenance, management, repair, possession or operation of the Premises (including<br>
without limitation, any taxes on revenues, rents, income, awards, proceeds, capital gains, profits,<br>
excess profits, gross receipts, sales, use, excise and other taxes, duties or imports whether similar<br>
or not in nature, assessed, levied or imposed against Tenant, Landlord or the Premises by any<br>
governmental authority).  If any assessment may be paid in installments, Tenant shall have the<br>
option to pay such assessment in installments; in such event, Tenant shall be liable only for those<br>
installments which become due and payable during the Term.  Tenant shall prepare and file all<br>
tax reports required by governmental authorities which relate to the Impositions.  Tenant shall<br>
upon Landlord's request, deliver to Landlord copies of all receipts for payment of Impositions.<br>
Landlord shall either request the applicable taxing authority to deliver tax notices or tax bills<br>
directly to Tenant, or provide Tenant with complete and correct copies of such tax notices or tax<br>
bills promptly upon Landlord's receipt thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Impositions will<br>
not include federal, state or local (i) franchise, capital stock or similar taxes, of Landlord, (ii) net<br>
income, net rental, excess profits or other taxes, of Landlord, or (iii) any estate, inheritance,<br>
succession, gift, capital levy or similar tax, unless such taxes referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)<br>
above are in lieu of, or a substitute for, any tax, assessment, levy or charge which, if it were in<br>
effect on the Commencement Date, would be payable by Tenant under this Lease.  Upon the<br>
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Landlord and Tenant shall prorate any pre-paid<br>
real property taxes applicable to the period after such expiration or termination date and any<br>
unpaid real property taxes attributable to the period prior to such expiration or termination date.<BR>

Tenant<br>
shall at all times comply with and cause the Premises to comply with and conform to all Legal<br>
Requirements applicable to the Premises or its ownership, occupancy or use, including those<br>
which require structural, unforeseen or extraordinary changes to the Premises.  Notwithstanding<br>
anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall not be required to make any structural<br>
improvements to the Premises required by a change in Legal Requirements in effect as of the<br>
date of this Lease.<BR>

(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Additional Obligations</U>.  Tenant shall pay and perform all obligations of<br>
Landlord, as the owner of the Premises, that may now or hereafter exist under any Permitted<br>
Encumbrances or any other matter that would be a Permitted Encumbrance created by or with the<br>
consent of Tenant.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant may use the Premises for any lawful purpose other than any use<br>
that will (i) have a material adverse effect on the value of the Premises, (ii) materially increase<br>
the likelihood that Tenant, Landlord or Lender would incur liability under any provisions of the<br>
Act referred to in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;27</U> of this Lease, or (iii) result or give rise to any material<br>
environmental deterioration or degradation of the Premises.  In no event shall the Premises be<br>
used for any purpose which shall violate any of the provisions of any recorded covenants,<br>
restrictions or agreements applicable to the Premises.  Tenant agrees that with respect to any such<br>
recorded covenants, restrictions or agreements, Tenant shall observe, perform and comply with<br>
and carry out the provisions thereof required therein to be observed and performed by Landlord.<BR>

shall not permit any unlawful occupation, business or trade to be conducted on any of the<br>
Premises or any use to be made thereof contrary to applicable Legal Requirements or Insurance<br>
Requirements.  Subject to Tenant's rights of contest under <U>Paragraph&nbsp;18</U> hereof, Tenant shall not<br>
use, occupy or permit any of the Premises to be used or occupied, nor do or permit anything to be<br>
done in or on any of the Premises, in a manner which would (i) violate any certificate of<br>
occupancy or equivalent certificate affecting any of the Premises, (ii) make void or voidable any<br>
insurance which Tenant is required hereunder to maintain then in force with respect to any of the<br>
Premises, (iii) affect in any manner the ability of Tenant to obtain any insurance which Tenant is<br>
required to furnish hereunder, (iv) cause any injury or damage to any of the Improvements unless<br>
pursuant to Alterations permitted under <U>Paragraph&nbsp;11</U> hereof, or (v) constitute a public or private<br>

Default exists hereunder, Landlord covenants that neither it nor any party claiming by, through or<br>
under it, shall do any act to disturb the peaceful and quiet occupation and enjoyment of the<br>
Premises by Tenant.  Landlord may enter upon and examine any of the Premises at reasonable<br>
times after reasonable notice and during business hours without notice and exercise any rights<br>
and privileges granted to Landlord under the provisions of this Lease.<BR>

which may be required to be made upon or in connection with any of the Premises in order to<br>
keep and maintain the Premises in as good repair and appearance as they were as of the<br>
Commencement Date, except for ordinary wear and tear.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant<br>
shall not be required to make structural repairs or structural replacements to the Improvements,<br>
the Land or Landlord's Trade Fixtures, unless such repair or replacement is needed because of<br>
Tenant's act or failure to maintain such items.  Tenant shall not be required to maintain the<br>
Racking/Shelving Items in the Premises in the same condition as at the Commencement Date;<br>
provided, however, that Tenant shall make any structural repairs or structural replacements<br>
necessary to the Racking/Shelving Items so that the system is operable for its intended purpose.<br>
Tenant shall do or cause others to do all that is necessary to plow or otherwise remove any and<br>
all accumulated snow from the Premises and Adjoining Property and keep both in safe condition.<br>
Tenant shall do or cause others to do all shoring of the Premises or Adjoining Property or of<br>
foundations and walls of the Improvements and every other act necessary or appropriate for<br>
preservation and safety thereof, by reason of or in connection with any excavation or other<br>
building operation upon any of the Premises or Adjoining Property, whether or not Landlord<br>
shall, by reason of any Legal Requirements or Insurance Requirements, be required to take such<br>
action or be liable for failure to do so.  Landlord shall not be required to make any repair,<br>
whether foreseen or unforeseen, or to maintain any of the Premises or Adjoining Property in any<br>
way, and Tenant hereby expressly waives the right to make repairs at the expense of the<br>
Landlord, which right may otherwise be provided for in any law now or hereafter in effect.<br>
Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to preclude Tenant from being entitled to<br>
insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for Restoration pursuant to the terms of this Lease.<br>
Tenant shall, in all events, make all repairs for which it is responsible hereunder promptly, but in<br>
no event longer than thirty (30) days after a repair or replacement becomes prudent, and all<br>
repairs shall be in a good, proper and workmanlike manner, and diligently pursued to completion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Tenant shall be in default under any of the provisions of this<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;9</U>, Landlord or Lender may, after thirty (30) days' notice to Tenant and failure of<br>
Tenant to commence to cure during said period or to diligently prosecute such cure to completion<br>
once begun, but immediately upon notice in the event of an emergency (that is, imminent danger<br>
of injury to persons or property), do whatever is necessary to cure such default as may be<br>
reasonable under the circumstances for the account of and at the expense of Tenant.  In the event<br>
of an emergency, before Landlord may avail itself of its rights under this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;9(b)</U>,<br>
Landlord shall send notice to Tenant of the situation by telephone or other available<br>
communication.  All actual and reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation,<br>
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) so incurred by Landlord or Lender, together with<br>
interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date of payment or incurring the expense, shall<br>
constitute Additional Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease and shall be paid by Tenant to<br>
Landlord or Lender (as applicable) on demand.  Tenant agrees that, in the event of an emergency,<br>
expenditures which might otherwise be unreasonable (such as overtime) may nevertheless be<br>
reasonable under the circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall from time to time replace with other similar operational<br>
equipment or parts any of the mechanical systems or other equipment included in the<br>
Improvements which shall have become worn out, obsolete or unusable for the purpose for which<br>
it is intended, been taken by a Condemnation as provided in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;12</U>, or been lost, stolen,<br>
damaged or destroyed as provided in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;14</U>.  Tenant shall repair at its sole cost and<br>
expense all damage to the Premises caused by the removal of equipment or any other personal<br>
property of Tenant at any time, including upon expiration or termination of the Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Liens</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant will promptly remove and discharge any charge, lien, security<br>
interest or encumbrance upon the Premises or any Basic Rent, Additional Rent or other sums<br>
payable hereunder which arise for any reason, including all liens which arise out of the<br>
possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or rebuilding of the Premises or by reason of<br>
labor or materials furnished or claimed to have been furnished to Tenant or for the Premises, but<br>
not including (i) the Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) any mortgage, charge, lien, security<br>
interest or encumbrance created by Landlord on or after the Commencement Date without the<br>
consent of Tenant.  Nothing contained in this Lease shall be construed as constituting the consent<br>
or request of Landlord, express or implied, to or for the performance by any contractor, laborer,<br>
materialmen, or vendor of any labor or services or for the furnishing of any materials for any<br>
construction, alteration, addition, repair or demolition of or to the Premises or any part thereof<br>
which would result in any liability of the Landlord for payment thereof.  Notice is hereby given<br>
that Landlord will not be liable for any labor, services or materials furnished or to be furnished to<br>
Tenant, or to anyone holding an interest in the Premises or any part thereof through or under<br>
Tenant, and that no mechanic's or other liens for any such labor, services or materials shall attach<br>
to or affect the interest of Landlord in and to the Premises.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Alterations</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall not make any Alterations which would diminish the value<br>
of the Premises or adversely affect any building systems or equipment.  Tenant may make any<br>
other Alterations without the prior written consent of the Landlord provided:  (i) such Alterations<br>
comply with all of the provisions of the following sentence and (ii) such Alterations are<br>
nonstructural.  All Alterations shall be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, and shall<br>
be expeditiously completed in compliance with all Legal Requirements.  All work done in<br>
connection with any such Alteration shall comply with all Insurance Requirements.  Tenant shall<br>
promptly pay all costs and expenses of any such Alteration, and shall discharge all liens filed<br>
against any of the Premises arising out of the same.  Tenant shall procure and pay for all permits<br>
and licenses required in connection with any such Alteration.  All such Alterations shall be the<br>
property of Landlord and shall be subject to this Lease.  All structural Alterations and any<br>
Alteration the estimated cost of which in any one instance exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars<br>
($50,000.00) shall be made under the supervision of a licensed architect or engineer in<br>
accordance with detailed plans and specifications which shall be submitted to Landlord and<br>
Lender at least twenty (20) days prior to the commencement of the Alterations.  Upon completion<br>
of any structural Alteration or one in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) Tenant will<br>
provide as-built plans and specifications or record drawings to Landlord and Lender.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the institution of any<br>
proceeding for Condemnation, Tenant shall notify Landlord and Lender thereof and Landlord and<br>
Lender shall be entitled to participate in any Condemnation proceeding at their own expense.<br>
Landlord and Lender, immediately upon obtaining knowledge of the institution of any<br>
proceeding for Condemnation, shall notify Tenant thereof and Tenant shall have the right to<br>
participate in such proceedings at its own expense.  Subject to the provisions of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;12<br>
</U>and <U>Paragraph&nbsp;15</U>, Tenant hereby irrevocably assigns to Lender or to Landlord, in that order, any<br>
award or payment in respect of any Condemnation of Tenant's interest in the Premises, except<br>
that nothing in this Lease shall be deemed to require (i) the assignment to Landlord or Lender of<br>
any award or payment on account of Tenant's Trade Fixtures, or other tangible personal property,<br>
moving expenses and similar claims, if available, to the extent Tenant shall have a right to make<br>
a separate claim therefor against the condemnor or (ii) any act or circumstance that impairs<br>
Tenant's right to any such award or payment; it being agreed, however, that Tenant shall in no<br>
event be entitled to any payment that reduces the award to which Landlord is or would be entitled<br>
for the condemnation of Landlord's interest in the Premises.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If (i) the entire Premises or (ii) at least fifty percent (50%) of the Land or<br>
the building constructed on the Land, the loss of which even after Restoration would, in Tenant's<br>
reasonable business judgment, be substantially and materially adverse to the business operations<br>
of Tenant, shall be the subject of a Taking, then Tenant shall have the right to, not later than sixty<br>
(60) days after a Taking has occurred, serve notice upon Landlord (&quot;Tenant's Termination<br>
Notice&quot;) of its intention to terminate this Lease on any Basic Rent Payment Date specified in<br>
such notice, which date (the &quot;Termination Date&quot;) shall be no sooner than the first Basic Rent<br>
Payment Date occurring at least thirty (30) days after the date of Tenant's Termination Notice<br>
and not later than the third Basic Rent Payment Date occurring after the date of Tenant's<br>
Termination Notice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that Tenant shall serve Tenant's Termination Notice upon Landlord, this<br>
Lease and the Term hereof shall terminate on the Termination Date.  In such event the entire<br>
award made in Condemnation proceeding shall be paid to Lender, or to Landlord, in that order.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of any Condemnation of part of the Premises which does not<br>
result in a Termination of this Lease, subject to the requirements of <U>Paragraph&nbsp;15</U>, the Net Award<br>
of such Condemnation shall be retained by Landlord or Lender and, promptly after such<br>
Condemnation, Landlord shall commence and diligently continue to perform the Restoration, but<br>
only to the extent of that portion of the Net Award designated for such work.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a Requisition of any of the Premises, Landlord shall apply the Net Award<br>
of such Requisition, to the extent available, to the installments (proportionately in the same ratio<br>
of the Premises taken to the otherwise whole Premises) of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or other<br>
sums payable by Tenant hereunder thereafter payable and Tenant shall pay the balance remaining<br>
thereafter.  Upon the expiration of the Term, any portion of such Net Award that shall not<br>
previously have been credited to Tenant on account of the Basic Rent and Additional Rent shall<br>
be retained by Landlord or Lender.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No agreement with any condemnor in settlement of or under threat of any<br>
Condemnation shall be made by Tenant without the written consent of Landlord and of Lender, if<br>
the Premises are then subject to a Mortgage, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or<br>
delayed provided such award or payment is applied in accordance with this Lease.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Type of Insurance</U>.  Tenant shall maintain at its sole cost and expense the<br>
following insurance on the Premises:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Form property insurance (including flood insurance and<br>
earthquake insurance each to the extent applicable and/or required by Lender; provided, however,<br>
that the limit of any such earthquake insurance policy shall not be greater than $5,000,000)<br>
against all risk of direct physical loss or damage to the Improvements in amounts not less than<br>
the full replacement cost of the Improvements, if the same are actually replaced, or actual cash<br>
value (replacement cost minus depreciation) if the same are not replaced, excluding footings and<br>
foundations and other parts of the Improvements which are not insurable, with an &quot;Amendment<br>
of the Pollution Exclusion Endorsement&quot; for damage caused by heat, smoke, or fumes from a<br>
hostile fire.  Tenant shall also obtain: (i) business interruption or rental interruption insurance, as<br>
requested by Landlord, in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Basic Rent and<br>
Additional Rent for a period of no less than eighteen (18) months and shall make any proceeds<br>
therefrom available to Landlord and Lender, and (ii) ordinance and law coverage, including, but<br>
not limited to, for extra costs and/or loss of value to the Premises because of any changes in<br>
building codes. <BR>
<BR>

(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commercial General Liability insurance against claims for bodily<br>
injury, death or property damage occurring on, in, or about the Premises, which insurance shall:<br>
(i) be written on a so-called &quot;occurrence basis,&quot; with combined single limit coverage of not less<br>
than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00), or in such increased limits as Landlord may<br>
reasonably request from time to time and (ii) include premises and operations liability coverage,<br>
products and completed operations liability coverage, blanket contractual liability coverage,<br>
including, to the maximum extent possible, coverage for the indemnification obligations of<br>
Tenant under this Lease, a &quot;severability of interest&quot; clause or endorsement which precludes the<br>
insurer from denying the claim of Tenant or Landlord because of the negligence or other acts of<br>
the other, and personal and advertising injury coverage.  Policies for such insurance shall be for<br>
the mutual benefit of Landlord, Tenant and any Lender.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workers' compensation insurance covering all persons employed in<br>
connection with any work done on or about the Premises (or in lieu of such workers'<br>
compensation insurance, a program of self-insurance complying with the rules, regulations and<br>
requirements of the appropriate agency of the State), including employer's liability coverage with<br>
limits of at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) with &quot;stop gap&quot; and &quot;all states&quot;<br>
endorsements. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other insurance coverage that is customarily carried by owners<br>
or tenants of similar properties in the same geographic area and engaged in businesses similar to<br>
Tenant's business or that may from time to time be reasonably required by Landlord or by Lender<br>
in order to protect their respective interests.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Insurance Requirements</U>.  The insurance required by <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13(a)</U> shall<br>
be written by companies, licensed to do business in the State, of recognized financial standing<br>
which are rated A- or better by A. M. Best Company or A3 or better by Moody's Investors<br>
Services, in either case with asset size rating of &quot;VIII&quot; or better by A. M. Best Company.  The<br>
insurance shall (i) be for a term of not less than twelve (12) months; (ii) be in amounts sufficient<br>
at all times to satisfy any co-insurance requirements thereof; (iii) provide an &quot;Additional
Insured-<br>
Managers or Lessors of Premises Endorsement&quot;; (iv) provide that the insurance company has the<br>
duty to defend all insureds under the policy; (v) provide that defense costs are paid in addition to<br>
and do not deplete any of the policy limits; (vi) (except for the workers' compensation insurance<br>
referred to in <U>Subparagraph&nbsp;13(a)(iii)</U> above) name Landlord, Tenant, and any Lender as insured<br>
parties as their respective interests may appear; (vii) provide that such insurance cannot be<br>
canceled, invalidated, or suspended on account of the conduct of Tenant, its officers, directors,<br>
employees, or agents; (viii) provide that any &quot;no other insurance&quot; clause in the insurance policy<br>
shall exclude any policies of insurance maintained by Landlord and the insurance policy shall not<br>
be brought into contribution with insurance maintained by Landlord; (ix) provide that the policy<br>
of insurance shall not be terminated, canceled or substantially modified without at least thirty<br>
(30) days' prior written notice to Landlord, Lender and to any other lender covered by any<br>
standard mortgage clause endorsement; (x) provide that the insurer shall not have the option to<br>
restore the Premises if Landlord elects to terminate this Lease in accordance with the terms<br>
hereof; (xi) provide that the interests of Landlord and Lender shall not be invalidated by any<br>
action or inaction of the Landlord, Tenant, or any other person, and such insurance shall insure<br>
the Lender regardless of any breach or violation by the Tenant, the Landlord, or any other person<br>
of any warranties, declarations, or conditions contained in the policies relating to such insurance<br>
or application therefore; and (xii) provide that all insurance proceeds payable under any policy of<br>
property, sprinkler, or flood insurance with respect to the Premises shall be paid to Lender as sole<br>
loss payee under a standard mortgagee clause (or if no Lender exists, to Landlord).  If said<br>
insurance or any part thereof shall expire, be withdrawn, become void by breach of any condition<br>
thereof by Tenant, or become void or unsafe by reason of the failure or impairment of the capital<br>
of any insurer, or if for any other reasonable cause said insurance shall become unsatisfactory to<br>
Landlord or Lender, Tenant shall promptly obtain new or additional insurance satisfactory to<br>
Landlord and Lender.  Tenant shall provide Landlord with certificates of insurance (ACORD<br>
Form 27) of all such insurance policies; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of any<br>
event insured by such an insurance policy, or if otherwise required by Lender, Tenant shall<br>
provide Landlord with a copy of such insurance policy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each insurance policy referred to above shall, to the extent applicable,<br>
contain standard non-contributory mortgagee clauses in favor of any Lender.  As evidence of the<br>
insurance specified in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13(a)(i)</U>, required to be maintained by Tenant, Tenant shall<br>
deliver to Landlord an ACORD 27 Evidence of Property Insurance or other certificate providing<br>
at least the same assurances (or, if limited by Legal Requirements, then a certificate providing as<br>
many of the same assurances as allowed by applicable law).  As evidence of the insurance<br>
specified in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13(a)(ii)</U> and <U>(iii)</U>, required to be maintained by Tenant, Tenant shall<br>
deliver to Landlord an ACORD 25 Certificate of Insurance or other certificate providing at least<br>
the same assurances.  The coverage provided by Tenant in respect of each policy shall also<br>
provide that any loss otherwise payable thereunder shall be payable notwithstanding (i) any act or<br>
omission of Landlord, Lender or Tenant which might, absent such provision, result in a forfeiture<br>
of all or a part of such insurance payment, (ii) the occupation or use of any of the Premises for<br>
purposes more hazardous than permitted by the provisions of such policy, (iii) any foreclosure or<br>
other action or proceeding taken by any Lender pursuant to any provision of the Mortgage upon<br>
the happening of an event of default therein, or (iv) any change in title or ownership of any of the<br>
Premises.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall pay as they become due all premiums for the insurance<br>
required by this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U>, shall renew or replace each policy prior to the expiration date<br>
stated on the policy then in effect, and shall deliver to Landlord and Lender the appropriate<br>
assurances for such renewals or replacements in accordance with the provisions of this<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;13(d)</U> before expiration of the then-effective coverage.  In the event of Tenant's failure<br>
to comply with any of the foregoing requirements of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U> within five (5) days of<br>
written notice from Landlord, Landlord or Lender shall be entitled to procure such insurance.<br>
Any sums expended by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be, in procuring such insurance shall<br>
be Additional Rent and shall be repaid by Tenant, together with interest thereon at the Default<br>
Rate, from the time of payment by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be, until fully paid by<br>
Tenant immediately upon written demand therefor by Landlord or Lender, as the case may be.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything in this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U> to the contrary notwithstanding, any<br>
insurance which Tenant is required to obtain pursuant to <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13(a)</U> may be carried under a<br>
&quot;blanket&quot; policy or policies covering other properties or liabilities of Tenant, provided that such<br>
&quot;blanket&quot; policy or policies otherwise comply with the provisions of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U>.  In the<br>
event any such insurance is carried under a blanket policy, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord and<br>
Lender a certified copy of those provisions of the blanket policy that pertain to the Premises, if<br>
any, to evidence the issuance and effectiveness of the policy, the amount and character of the<br>
coverage with respect to the Premises and the presence in the policy of provisions of the<br>
character required in the above sections of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to any risk covered by property damage insurance, except for<br>
any obligations arising under this Lease, Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any rights each may<br>
have against the other on account of any loss or damage occasioned to Landlord or to Tenant, as<br>
applicable, their respective property, the Improvements, or their contents, or to other<br>
improvements, to the extent of any insurance proceeds received by the waiving party for such<br>
loss or damage.  The parties each, on behalf of their respective insurance companies insuring the<br>
property of either Landlord or Tenant against any such loss, waive any right of subrogation that<br>
they may have against Landlord or Tenant, as applicable.&nbsp;<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of any casualty loss exceeding Ten Thousand Dollars<br>
($10,000.00), Tenant shall give Landlord and Lender immediate notice thereof.  Tenant shall<br>
adjust, collect and compromise any and all such claims, with the consent of Lender and Landlord,<br>
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and Landlord and Lender shall have the right to join<br>
with Tenant therein.  All proceeds of any insurance shall be paid to a Trustee which shall be a<br>
federally insured bank or other financial institution, selected by Landlord and Tenant and<br>
reasonably satisfactory to Lender (the &quot;Trustee&quot;).  If the Premises shall be covered by a<br>
Mortgage, Lender, if it so desires, shall be the Trustee.  Each insurer is hereby authorized and<br>
directed to make payment under said policies directly to such Trustee instead of to Landlord and<br>
Tenant jointly, and Tenant hereby appoints such Trustee as Tenant's attorney-in-fact to endorse<br>
any draft therefor for the purposes set forth in this Lease after approval by Tenant of such<br>
Trustee, if Trustee is other than Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or<br>
delayed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of any casualty (whether or not insured against) resulting in<br>
damage to (i) the entire Premises or (ii) at least fifty percent (50%) of the Premises, the loss of<br>
which even after Restoration would, in Tenant's reasonable business judgment, be substantially<br>
and materially adverse to the business operations of Tenant, Tenant shall have the right, not later<br>
than sixty (60) days after such casualty has occurred, to serve a Tenant's Termination Notice<br>
upon Landlord.  If Tenant shall serve a Tenant's Termination Notice upon Landlord, this Lease<br>
shall terminate on the Termination Date, which shall be as set forth in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;12(b)</U>, specified<br>
in such Termination Notice; however, Tenant shall assign and make available to Landlord all<br>
insurance proceeds for such casualty and pay to Landlord any deductible therefor, before any<br>
such Termination becomes effective.  If this Lease is not terminated pursuant to this <U>Paragraph<br>
14(b)</U>, Landlord shall commence and diligently continue to perform the Restoration to the<br>
Premises.  Tenant shall be responsible for any deductible under any insurance required under<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;13</U>.  Upon the Trustee's receipt of the entire proceeds of any insurance required under<br>
<U>Paragraph&nbsp;13</U>, together with any self-insurance payment required of Tenant, less any expenses<br>
incurred by Landlord, Tenant, or any Lender in collecting such proceeds or payment (&quot;Net<br>
Proceeds&quot;), the Trustee shall, to the extent available, make the Net Proceeds available to<br>
Landlord for Restoration, in accordance with the provisions of <U>Paragraph&nbsp;15</U>. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that any damage or destruction shall occur at such time as<br>
Tenant shall not have maintained third-party insurance in accordance with <U>Paragraph&nbsp;13(a)(i)</U>,<br>
Tenant shall pay to the Trustee the amount of the proceeds that would have been payable had<br>

<U>Restoration</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Net Proceeds and Tenant Insurance Payment (the aggregate of<br>
which and any interest being herein defined as the &quot;Restoration Fund&quot;) paid to the Trustee shall<br>
be disbursed by the Trustee to Landlord.  Landlord shall only be obligated to restore the Premises<br>
to the extent of the funds Landlord receives from the Restoration Fund.  Any sum in the<br>
Restoration Fund which remains in the Restoration Fund upon the completion of Restoration<br>
shall be paid to Tenant.&nbsp;<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the following provisions of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;16(a)</U>, Tenant agrees<br>
that this Lease shall, upon Landlord's and Lender's (if any) written request, be subject and<br>
subordinate to the lien of any Mortgage, and Tenant agrees, upon demand, without cost, to<br>
execute instruments as may be required to further effectuate or confirm such subordination.  So<br>
long as no Event of Default shall be outstanding, Tenant's tenancy shall not be disturbed, nor<br>
shall this Lease be affected by any default under such Mortgage, and in the event of a foreclosure<br>
or other enforcement of any such Mortgage, or sale in lieu thereof, the purchaser at such<br>
foreclosure sale shall be bound to Tenant for the Term of this Lease and any extensions thereof,<br>
the rights of Tenant hereunder shall expressly survive, and this Lease shall in all respects<br>
continue in full force and effect so long as no Event of Default by Tenant has occurred and is<br>
continuing.  So long as no Event of Default by Tenant has occurred and is continuing, Tenant<br>
shall not be named as a party defendant in any such foreclosure suit, except as may be required<br>
by law.  <BR>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;16</U>, the<br>
holder of the Mortgage to which this Lease is subject and subordinate, as provided in said<br>
subdivision (a), shall have the right, at its sole option, at any time, to subordinate and subject the<br>
Mortgage, in whole or in part, to this Lease by recording a unilateral declaration to such effect.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time prior to the expiration of the Term, Tenant agrees, at the<br>
election and upon demand of any owner of the Premises, or of Lender who has granted
non-<br>
disturbance to Tenant pursuant to <U>Paragraph&nbsp;16(a)</U> above, to attorn, from time to time, to any<br>
such owner or Lender, upon the then executory terms and conditions of this Lease, for the<br>
remainder of the term originally demised in this Lease and for any renewal term, provided that<br>
such owner or Lender shall then be entitled to possession of the Premises subject to the<br>
provisions of this Lease.  The provisions of this subdivision (c) shall enure to the benefit of any<br>
such owner or Lender, shall apply notwithstanding that, as a matter of law, this Lease may<br>
terminate upon the foreclosure of the Mortgage, shall be self-operative upon any such demand,<br>
and no further instrument shall be required to give effect to said provisions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant and Landlord agree that, if requested by the other, each shall,<br>
&nbsp;without charge, enter into (i) a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement<br>
reasonably requested by Lender, provided such agreement contains provisions relating to
non-<br>
disturbance in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (a), and (ii) an agreement with<br>
Lender whereby Tenant shall agree for the benefit of Lender that Tenant will not, without in each<br>
case the prior written consent of Lender, (a) amend, modify, cancel or surrender the term of this<br>
Lease except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Lease, or enter into any agreement<br>
with Landlord so to do, or (b) pay any installment of Basic Rent more than one (1) month in<br>
advance of the due date thereof or otherwise than in the manner provided for in this Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any time after Landlord has advised Tenant of the existence of a<br>
&quot;Lender&quot; hereunder, and before such Lender has confirmed to Tenant that the lien of its<br>
Mortgage has been released, Tenant shall not (and shall not be obligated, even upon the request<br>
of Landlord, to) execute any agreement or document purporting to subordinate this Lease to the<br>
lien of any mortgage or deed of trust other than the Mortgage held by Lender.<BR>

<U>Assignment, Subleasing</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant is currently in occupancy and is operating its business at the<br>
Premises.  Tenant may not assign its interest in this Lease or sublease any portion(s) of the<br>
Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably<br>
withheld or delayed.  No sublease under, or assignment or other transfer of, this Lease shall<br>
relieve Tenant of its obligations hereunder, which shall continue as the obligations of a principal<br>
and not as the obligations of a surety or a guarantor.  The joint and several liability of Tenant<br>
named herein and any immediate and remote successor in interest of Tenant (by assignment or<br>
otherwise), and the due performance of the obligations of this Lease on Tenant's part to be<br>
performed or observed, shall not in any way be discharged, released or impaired by any (i)<br>
agreement which modifies any of the rights or obligations of the parties under this Lease, (ii)<br>
stipulation which extends the time within which an obligation under this Lease is to be<br>
performed, (iii) waiver of the performance of an obligation required under this Lease, or (iv)<br>
failure to enforce any of the obligations set forth in this Lease, unless in each case, the same has<br>
been consented to by Landlord and Lender.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each sublease of the Premises or any part thereof shall be subject and<br>
subordinate to the provisions of this Lease.  Tenant agrees that in the case of an assignment,<br>
Tenant shall, not less than ten (10) days prior to the execution and delivery of any such<br>
assignment as described in this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;17(b)</U>, give notice of such assignment to Landlord.<br>
Tenant further agrees that in the case of such assignment, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days<br>
after the execution and delivery of any such assignment, deliver to Landlord (i) a duplicate<br>
original of such assignment in recordable form and (ii) an agreement executed and acknowledged<br>
by the assignee in recordable form wherein the assignee shall agree to assume and agree to<br>
observe and perform all of the terms and provisions of this Lease on the part of the Tenant to be<br>
observed and performed from and after the date of such assignment, and, in the case of a<br>
sublease, Tenant shall, within fifteen (15) days after the execution and delivery of such sublease,<br>
deliver to Landlord a duplicate original of such sublease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under this Lease, Landlord<br>
shall have the right to collect and enjoy all rents and other sums of money payable under any<br>
sublease of any of the Premises, and Tenant hereby irrevocably and unconditionally assigns all<br>
rights under any such sublease including rents and money to Landlord, which assignment may be<br>
exercised upon and after (but not before) the occurrence of an Event of Default.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any sublease shall provide that upon notice from Landlord and Lender of<br>
an Event of Default, all rent due under such sublease shall be paid as so directed.  In no event<br>
shall Landlord or Lender have the right to direct the payment of sublease rents to any party other<br>
than Tenant except in an aggregate amount equal to or less than the aggregate amounts due<br>
hereunder.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Permitted Contests</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary,<br>
after prior written notice to Landlord and Lender and provided Landlord shall not have elected to<br>
terminate this Lease as a result of an Event of Default, Tenant shall not be required to (i) pay any<br>
Tax, (ii) comply with any Legal Requirement, or (iii) discharge or remove any lien, so long as<br>
Tenant shall contest, in good faith and at its expense, the existence, the amount or the validity<br>
thereof, the amount of the damages caused thereby, or the extent of its or Landlord's liability<br>
therefor, by appropriate proceedings which shall operate during the pendency thereof to prevent<br>
(v) the collection of, or other realization upon, the Tax or lien so contested, (w) the sale,<br>
forfeiture or loss of any of the Premises, any Basic Rent or any Additional Rent to satisfy the<br>
same or to pay any damages caused by the violation of the same, (x) any interference with the use<br>
or occupancy of any of the Premises, (y) any interference with the payment of any Basic Rent or<br>
any Additional Rent, and (z) the cancellation of any fire or other insurance policy.  In no event<br>
shall Tenant pursue any contest with respect to any Tax, Legal Requirement, or lien referred to<br>
above in such manner that exposes Landlord, Tenant or Lender to any criminal liability, penalty<br>
or sanction or material civil liability for which Tenant has not made provisions reasonably<br>
acceptable to Landlord and Lender.  Tenant shall be deemed to have made provisions reasonably<br>
acceptable to Landlord and Lender if Tenant shall have provided Lender or Landlord in that order<br>
as security for such contest, an amount of cash or bond equal to one hundred twenty-five percent<br>
(125%) of the amount being contested, or other security satisfactory in the reasonable opinion of<br>
Lender or Landlord in that order, in assuring the payment, compliance, discharge, removal or<br>
other action, including all costs, attorneys' fees, interest and penalties, in the event that the<br>
contest is unsuccessful.  While any such proceedings are pending and the required security is<br>
held by Lender or Landlord, in that order, Lender or Landlord, as the case may be, shall not have<br>
the right to pay, remove or cause to be discharged the Tax, Legal Requirement or lien thereby<br>
being contested unless Landlord or Lender reasonably believes that any one or more of the<br>
conditions in subdivisions (v) through (z) shall not be prevented during the pendency of the<br>
contest.  Tenant further agrees that each such contest shall be promptly and diligently prosecuted<br>
to a final conclusion, except that Tenant shall, so long as all of the conditions of the first sentence<br>
of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;18</U> are at all times complied with, have the right to attempt to settle or<br>
compromise such contest through negotiations.  Tenant shall pay any and all judgments, decrees<br>
and costs (including all attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with any such contest and<br>
shall, promptly after the final determination of such contest, fully pay and discharge the amounts<br>
which shall be levied, assessed, charged or imposed or be determined to be payable therein or in<br>
connection therewith, together with all penalties, fines, interest, costs and expenses thereof or in<br>
connection therewith, and perform all acts the performance of which shall be ordered or decreed<br>
as a result thereof.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Default</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall constitute<br>
an Event of Default under this Lease:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant's failure to make any payment of Basic Rent, Additional Rent or<br>
other sum herein required to be paid by Tenant when due which continues unremedied for a<br>
period of three (3) business days after notice thereof from Landlord or Lender; provided,<br>
however, that neither Landlord nor Lender shall have any obligation to give Tenant notice of<br>
such failure if Landlord or Lender has given such notice to Tenant three (3) times in any<br>
consecutive twelve (12) month period.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An event occurs which is described in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;21</U> (Bankruptcy;<br>
Insolvency) or Tenant causes, or gives cause for, the institution of any bankruptcy or receivership<br>
proceedings as are described in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;21</U>.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The estate or interest of Tenant in any of the Premises shall be levied upon<br>
or attached in any proceeding and such estate or interest is about to be sold or transferred or such<br>
process shall not be vacated or discharged within forty-five (45) days after such levy or<br>
attachment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A default occurs pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.<BR>

(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant's failure to duly perform and observe, or Tenant's violation or<br>
breach of, any other provision hereof not identified in (a) through (d) above, if such failure shall<br>
continue for a period of thirty (30) days after notice thereof from Landlord or Lender, or if such<br>
failure cannot be cured within such period of thirty (30) days, such period shall be extended for<br>
such longer time as reasonably necessary provided that Tenant has commenced to cure such<br>
default within said period of thirty (30) days and is actively, diligently and in good faith<br>
proceeding with continuity to remedy such failure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Landlord's Remedies</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the occurrence of an Event of Default by Tenant,<br>
Landlord shall have the right to exercise the following remedies:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord may, at its option, continue this Lease in full force and effect,<br>
without terminating Tenant's right to possession of the Premises, in which event Landlord shall<br>
have the right to collect Basic Rent and all other rent and charges when due.  In the alternative,<br>
Landlord shall have the right to peaceably re-enter the Premises on the terms set forth in<br>
subparagraph (b) below, but without such re-entry being deemed a termination of the Lease or an<br>
acceptance by Landlord of a surrender thereof.  Landlord shall also have the right, at its option,<br>
from time to time, without terminating this Lease, to relet the Premises, or any part thereof, with<br>
or without legal process, as the agent, and for the account, of Tenant upon such terms and<br>
conditions as Landlord may deem advisable in its sole and absolute discretion (which terms may<br>
be materially different from the terms of this Lease), in which event the rents received on such<br>
reletting shall be applied (i) first to the reasonable and actual expenses of such reletting and<br>
collection, including without limitation necessary renovation and alterations of the Premises,<br>
reasonable and actual attorneys' fees and any reasonable and actual real estate commissions paid,<br>
and (ii) thereafter toward payment of all sums due or to become due Landlord hereunder.  If a<br>
sufficient amount to pay such expenses and sums shall not be realized or secured, then Tenant<br>
shall pay Landlord any such deficiency monthly, and Landlord may bring an action therefor as<br>
such monthly deficiency shall arise.  Landlord shall not, in any event, be required to pay Tenant<br>
any sums received by Landlord on a reletting of the Premises in excess of the rent provided in<br>
this Lease, but such excess shall reduce any accrued present or future obligations of Tenant<br>
hereunder.  Landlord's re-entry and reletting of the Premises without termination of this Lease<br>
shall not preclude Landlord from subsequently terminating this Lease as set forth below.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord may terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant specifying a<br>
date therefor, and this Lease shall then terminate on the date so specified as if such date had been<br>
originally fixed as the expiration date of the Term.  In the event of such termination, Landlord<br>
shall be entitled to recover from Tenant the worth at the time of the award of all of the following:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any obligation which has accrued prior to the date of termination,<br>
plus<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of unpaid Basic Rent and all other charges which<br>
would have accrued after termination until the time of award.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of unpaid rent for the balance of the Term (excluding<br>
any option periods or portions thereof not previously exercised).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As used in this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;20(b)</U> the term, &quot;worth at the time of the award,&quot; shall be<br>
computed by allowing simple interest at the Default Rate for past due obligations, and using a<br>
discount rate equal to the federal discount rate per annum on anticipated future obligations, on<br>
the amount of the obligations payable on the date of such calculation.  In the event this Lease<br>
shall be terminated as provided above, by summary proceedings or otherwise, Landlord, its<br>
agents, servants or representatives may immediately or at any time thereafter peaceably re-enter<br>
and resume possession of the Premises and remove all persons and property therefrom, by<br>
summary dispossession proceedings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event Landlord has any duty to mitigate damages hereunder following an Event of<br>
Default and in any action or claim by Landlord or Lender against Tenant due to breach of this<br>
Lease following an Event of Default, Landlord shall not be required to construct, repair, modify<br>
or install any improvements in the Premises or to divide the Premises for multiple leaseholds in<br>
any way whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord may recover from Tenant, and Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon<br>
demand, as Additional Rent such reasonable and actual expenses as Landlord may incur<br>
in recovering possession of the Premises, placing the same in good order and condition and<br>
repairing the same for reletting, and all other reasonable and actual expenses, commissions and<br>
charges incurred by Landlord in exercising any remedy provided herein or as a result of any<br>
Event of Default by Tenant hereunder (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees),<br>
provided that in no event shall Landlord be obligated to incur any such expenses or take any such<br>
action in order to mitigate Tenant's damages.  <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;9</U> or <U>13(d)</U>, at any time upon prior notice to Tenant,<br>
Landlord and Lender shall have the right, but shall not be required, to pay such sums or do any<br>
act which requires the expenditure of monies which may be necessary or appropriate by reason of<br>
the failure or neglect of Tenant to comply with any of its obligations under this Lease (Landlord<br>
and Lender shall not, however, exercise any such rights unless the failure or neglect shall have<br>
ripened into an Event of Default), and in the event of the exercise of such right by Landlord or<br>
Lender, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord or Lender forthwith upon demand, as Additional Rent,<br>
all such sums including reasonable attorneys fees, together with interest thereon at the Default<br>
Rate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The various rights and remedies reserved to Landlord herein, are<br>
cumulative, the rights and remedies described in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;20(a)-(d)</U> shall survive termination of<br>
this Lease and Landlord may pursue any and all such rights and remedies and any other available<br>
to Landlord under applicable law or equity, whether at the same time or otherwise (to the extent<br>
not inconsistent with specific provisions of this Lease); provided, however, that no remedy of<br>
termination shall be available to Landlord except as expressly set forth in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;20(b)</U> after<br>
the occurrence of an Event of Default.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,<br>
Landlord expressly waives its right to forcibly dispossess Tenant from the Premises, whether<br>
peaceably or otherwise, without judicial process, such that Landlord shall not be entitled to any<br>
&quot;commercial lockout&quot; or any other provisions of applicable law which permit landlords to<br>
dispossess tenants from commercial properties without the benefit of judicial review.<BR>

(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Immediate Default</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tenant shall be deemed to be in default under this<br>
Lease (without Landlord giving any notice declaring such), upon the occurrence of an &quot;Event of<br>
Bankruptcy,&quot; which for the purposes of this Lease shall mean where Tenant or any part of the<br>
Premises are placed in the hands of a receiver or trustee, or should Tenant file a voluntary<br>
petition in bankruptcy, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, become unable to or<br>
admit in writing that it cannot pay its debts as such become due, or be finally adjudicated a<br>
bankrupt or insolvent, or should Tenant petition or institute any proceedings under the United<br>
States Bankruptcy Code or under any other state or federal act or law relating to the subject of<br>
bankruptcy wherein Tenant seeks to be adjudicated a bankrupt, or to be dismissed of its debts, or<br>
to effect a plan of dissolution, liquidation, readjustment, composition, arrangement, or<br>
reorganization, or should any involuntary proceeding equivalent or similar to any of the<br>
foregoing be filed against Tenant under any such bankruptcy laws, and not be dismissed within<br>
sixty (60) days thereafter.  The provisions of this Article shall also apply to each guarantor of this<br>
Lease to the same extent as if the word &quot;Tenant&quot; were replaced by the name of such guarantor<br>
throughout this Section, except that the first word hereof shall remain &quot;Tenant.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Assumption of Lease</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If an Event of Bankruptcy occurs, the receiver or<br>
trustee of Tenant's bankruptcy estate or Tenant as a debtor-in-possession may assume the Lease,<br>
and may subsequently assign it, only if it performs the following within sixty (60) days after the<br>
date of the filing of the voluntary petition, the entry of the order for relief or the date of<br>
conversion or admission of inability to pay debts as such become due (or such additional time as<br>
a court of competent jurisdiction may grant, for cause, upon a motion made within the original<br>
sixty (60) day period):<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 files a motion to assume the Lease with the appropriate court;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satisfies each of every one of the following conditions which<br>
Landlord and Tenant acknowledge to be commercially reasonable:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cures all monetary and nonmonetary defaults under the Lease or<br>
provides Landlord with Adequate Assurance (as defined in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;21(c)</U> below) that it will be<br>
able to cure all monetary defaults under the Lease within ten (10) days and all nonmonetary<br>
defaults within thirty (30) days from the date of assumption and  actually so cures all such<br>
monetary and nonmonetary defaults under the Lease within said time periods;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compensates Landlord or provides Landlord with Adequate<br>

a Mortgage and stating in said Notice its address for the receipt of Notices, then simultaneously<br>
with the giving of any Notice by Tenant to Landlord, Tenant shall serve one or more copies of<br>
such Notice upon Lender in the manner aforesaid and no Notice shall be effective unless and<br>
until Lender shall be sent a copy thereof.  For the purposes of this Paragraph, any party may<br>
substitute its address by giving fifteen days' notice to the other party in the manner provided<br>
above; however, Tenant must provide a street address within the State for personal delivery.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Memorandum Lease; Estoppel Certificates</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall execute, deliver and<br>
record, file or register from time to time all such instruments as may be required by any present<br>
or future law in order to evidence the respective interests of Landlord and Tenant in any of the<br>
Premises, and shall cause a memorandum of this Lease, substantially in the form attached hereto<br>
as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> (the &quot;Memorandum&quot;), and any supplement hereto or to such other instrument, if<br>
any, as may be appropriate, to be recorded, filed or registered and re-recorded, refiled or
re-<br>
registered in such manner and in such places as may be required by any present or future law in<br>
order to give public notice and protect the validity of this Lease.  In the event of any discrepancy<br>
between the provisions of said recorded memorandum of this Lease or any other recorded<br>
instrument referring to this Lease and the provisions of this Lease, the provisions of this Lease<br>
shall prevail.  Tenant shall, at any time and from time to time, within twenty (20) days after<br>
written request by Landlord (or, in the case of an estoppel certificate, within twenty (20) days<br>
after written request of Landlord or Lender), execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other a<br>
statement in writing, executed by Tenant or, if other than an individual, by a President, Vice<br>
President or authorized general partner, principal officer or agent certifying (i) that this Lease is<br>
unmodified and in full effect (or, if there have been modifications, that this Lease is in full effect<br>
as modified, setting forth such modifications); (ii) the dates to which Basic Rent payable<br>
hereunder has been paid; (iii) that to the knowledge of the party executing such certificate no<br>
default by either Landlord or Tenant exists hereunder or specifying each such of which such party<br>
may have knowledge; (iv) the remaining Term hereof; (v) that there are no proceedings pending<br>
or threatened against Tenant before or by any court or administrative agency which if adversely<br>
decided would materially and adversely affect the financial condition and operations of Tenant or<br>
if any such proceedings are pending or threatened to said party's knowledge, specifying and<br>
describing the same; and (vi) such other facts regarding the Lease, Premises or Tenant that are<br>
reasonably requested by Landlord.  It is intended that any such statements may be relied upon
by<br>
Lender, the recipient of such statements or their assignees or by any prospective mortgagee,<br>
purchaser, or assignee of Landlord.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Surrender and Holding Over</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this<br>
Lease, Tenant shall peaceably leave and surrender the Premises (except as to any portion thereof<br>
with respect to which this Lease has previously terminated) to Landlord in the same condition in<br>
which the Premises were originally received from Landlord at the commencement of this Lease,<br>
except as to the Racking/Shelving Items as set forth in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;9(a)</U>, any repair or Alteration as<br>
permitted or required by any provision of this Lease, and except for ordinary wear and tear and<br>
damage by fire, casualty or condemnation but only to the extent Tenant is not required to repair<br>
the same hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, within one (1) year after the<br>
Commencement Date, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense: (a) repair the roof to a<br>
Serviceable Condition (as defined on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;D</U> attached hereto and incorporated herein by this<br>
reference) and (b) repair the deferred maintenance items set forth in paragraph two of Landlord's<br>
letter of February 21, 2002, a copy of which is attached hereto as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;E</U> and incorporated<br>
herein by this reference).  Prior to the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall,<br>
at Tenant's sole cost and expense, remove the Racking/Shelving Items from the Building and<br>
repair any damage caused by such removal including without limitation capping all in-rack<br>
sprinklers, cutting all bolts and leaving the floor in a smooth condition.  Tenant may remove at<br>
Tenant's sole cost and expense from the Premises on or prior to such expiration or earlier<br>
termination Tenant's Trade Fixtures and personal property which are owned by Tenant or third<br>
parties other than Landlord, and Tenant at its expense shall, on or prior to such expiration or<br>
earlier termination, repair any damage caused by such removal.  Tenant's Trade Fixtures and<br>
personal property not so removed at the end of the Term or within thirty days after the earlier<br>
termination of the Term for any reason whatsoever shall become the property of Landlord, and<br>
Landlord may thereafter cause such property to be removed from the Premises.  Landlord shall<br>
not in any manner or to any extent be obligated to reimburse Tenant for any property which<br>
becomes the property of Landlord as a result of such expiration or earlier termination.  Upon<br>
such expiration or earlier termination, no party shall have any further rights or obligations<br>
hereunder except as specifically provided herein.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any holding over by Tenant of the Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of<br>
the term of this Lease or any extensions thereof shall operate and be construed as tenancy from<br>
month to month only, at one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Basic Rent reserved herein and<br>
upon the same terms and conditions as contained in this Lease.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,<br>
any holding over without Landlord's consent for a period greater than thirty (30) days shall<br>
entitle Landlord, in addition to collecting Basic Rent at a rate of two hundred percent (200%)<br>
thereof, to exercise all rights and remedies provided by law or in equity, including the remedies<br>
of <U>Paragraph&nbsp;20</U>.  During any holding over by Tenant of the Premises, Tenant shall be obligated<br>
to pay Landlord, in addition to Basic Rent as set forth in this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;24</U>, all Additional Rent<br>
due under this Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>No Merger of Title</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There shall be no merger of this Lease nor of the leasehold<br>
estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in or ownership of any of the Premises by reason<br>
of the fact that the same person, corporation, firm or other entity may acquire or hold or own,<br>
directly or indirectly, (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in<br>
this Lease or in such leasehold estate and (ii) the fee estate or ownership of any of the Premises<br>
or any interest in such fee estate or ownership.  No such merger shall occur unless and until all<br>
persons, corporations, firms and other entities having any interest in (x) this Lease or the<br>
leasehold estate created by this Lease and (y) the fee estate in or ownership of the Premises<br>
including, without limitation, Lender's interest therein, or any part thereof sought to be merged<br>
shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Landlord and Lender Exculpation</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything contained herein to the contrary<br>
notwithstanding, any claim based on or in respect of any liability of Landlord under this Lease<br>
shall be enforced only against the Landlord's interest in Premises and shall not be enforced<br>
against the Landlord individually or personally.  Tenant agrees that any assignment by Landlord<br>
of Landlord's interest in this Lease, or the rents payable hereunder, whether absolute or<br>
conditional in nature or otherwise, which assignment is made to Lender solely as additional<br>
collateral related to a mortgage, and the acceptance thereof by Lender shall never be treated as an<br>
assumption by Lender of any obligations of Landlord hereunder unless Lender shall, by notice<br>
sent to Tenant, specifically elect, and that Lender shall be treated as having assumed Landlord's<br>
obligations hereunder only upon purchase of the Premises pursuant to foreclosure of the<br>
Mortgage or by deed in lieu thereof, or other conveyance, and then only subject to the limitations<br>
set forth in the first sentence hereof.<BR>

(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the extent required by the Act and/or any federal, state or local laws,<br>
rules or regulations governing Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall remove any Hazardous<br>

this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;27(b)</U> are in addition to, and in no way limit, Tenant's indemnification obligations<br>
under <U>Paragraph&nbsp;35</U>.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant shall not engage in any activity in or on the Premises which<br>
constitutes a Reportable Use of Hazardous Materials without the express prior written consent of<br>

or neighboring properties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may use any ordinary and<br>
customary materials reasonably required to be used in the normal course of Tenant's business (in<br>
compliance with the use set forth in <U>Paragraph&nbsp;8</U> above) so long as such use is in compliance with<br>
all applicable Legal Requirements, is not a Reportable Use, and does not expose the Premises or<br>
neighboring property to any meaningful risk of contamination or damage or expose Landlord to<br>
any liability therefor.  In addition, Landlord may condition its consent to any Reportable Use<br>
upon receiving such additional assurances as Landlord reasonably deems necessary to protect<br>
itself, the public, the Premises, and/or the environment against damage, contamination, injury,<br>
and/or liability, including, but not limited to, the installation (and removal on or before Lease<br>
expiration or termination) of protective modifications (such as concrete encasements).  Tenant<br>
will not store combustible or flammable materials on the Premises in violation of the Act and any<br>
other federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations governing Hazardous Materials.  The<br>
provisions of this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;27</U> shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Entry by Landlord and Lender</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord, Lender and their authorized<br>
representatives shall have the right upon reasonable notice (which shall be not less than
twenty-<br>
four (24) hours except in the case of emergency) to enter the Premises at all reasonable business<br>
hours, (and at all other times in the event of an emergency), for (i) the purpose of inspecting the<br>
same, including, but not limited to, conducting soil, hydrology, environmental, and all other<br>
testing and examinations it deems necessary, or for the purpose of doing any work under<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;9</U>, and may take all such action thereon as may be necessary or appropriate for any<br>
such purpose (but nothing contained in this Lease or otherwise shall create or imply any duty<br>
upon the part of Landlord or Lender to make any such inspection or do any such work), and (ii)<br>
the purpose of showing the Premises to prospective purchasers and mortgagees and, at any time<br>
within twelve (12) months prior to the expiration of the term of this Lease for the purpose of<br>
showing the same to prospective tenants.  No such entry shall constitute an eviction of Tenant but<br>
any such entry shall be done by Landlord in such reasonable manner as to minimize any<br>
disruption of Tenant's business operation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Statements</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant named herein shall submit to Lender and Landlord within 90<br>
days of the end of each fiscal year, annual balance sheets, income and cash flow statements for<br>
Tenant named herein, certified by an independent public accountant.  Copies of the l0Ks filed<br>
with the Securities and Exchange Commission will satisfy the requirement contained in this<U><br>
Paragraph&nbsp;29</U>.  The obligations of Tenant named herein shall continue whether or not this Lease<br>
shall have been assigned.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>No Usury</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intention of the parties being to conform strictly to the usury laws<br>
now in force in the State, whenever any provision herein provides for payment by Tenant to<br>
Landlord of interest at a rate in excess of the legal rate permitted to be charged, such rate herein<br>
provided to be paid shall be deemed reduced to such legal rate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Broker</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landlord and Tenant each hereby represents and warrants to the other that<br>
no brokers represented Landlord and Tenant with respect to this Lease.  Each party hereby agrees<br>
to indemnify, protect, hold harmless and defend the other against all claims by any party for<br>
broker fees, finder fees or any other fee or commission in connection with this Lease based upon<br>
the actions of the indemnifying party.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Trade Fixtures or any property of Tenant and any Landlord's lien or similar lien upon Tenant's<br>
Trade Fixtures and any other property of Tenant regardless of whether such lien is created or<br>
otherwise.  Landlord agrees, at the request of Tenant, to execute a waiver of any Landlord's or<br>
similar lien for the benefit of any present or future holder of a security interest in or lessor of any<br>
of Tenant's Trade Fixtures or any other personal property of Tenant.  Landlord acknowledges<br>
and agrees in the future to acknowledge (in a written form reasonably satisfactory to Tenant) to<br>
such persons and entities at such times and for such purposes as Tenant may reasonably request<br>
that Tenant's Trade Fixtures are Tenant's property and not part of Improvements (regardless of<br>
whether or to what extent such Tenant's Trade Fixtures are affixed to the Improvements) or<br>
otherwise subject to the terms of this Lease; however, Landlord shall not be obligated or<br>
responsible to notify any such person of Tenant's default hereunder or keep safe any such<br>
Tenant's Trade Fixtures for the benefit of any such person, or allow any sales or auctions of such<br>
Tenant's Trade Fixtures on the Premises, and any such person shall be obligated to pay to<br>
Landlord rental or moving or storage fees incurred by Landlord for such Tenant's Trade Fixtures<br>
after the termination of this Lease and to repair any damage to the Premises caused by such<br>
person's removal of any Tenant's Trade Fixtures.  Tenant shall be obligated to pay Landlord's<br>
attorney fees for the review and/or preparation of any such acknowledgment.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>No Waiver</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No delay or failure by either party to enforce its rights hereunder shall<br>
be construed as a waiver, modification or relinquishment thereof.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Separability</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any term or provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any<br>
provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall to any<br>
extent be invalid and unenforceable, the remainder of this Lease, or the application of such term<br>
or provision to person or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or<br>
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Lease shall be<br>
valid and shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<U>Indemnification</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenant agrees to defend, pay, protect, indemnify, save and hold<br>
harmless Landlord, Landlord's members, partners, officers, directors, shareholders, employees<br>
and agents, and Lender (collectively, &quot;Indemnitees&quot;) from and against any and all liabilities,<br>
losses, damages, penalties, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),<br>

caused, arising from any of the Premises or Adjoining Property, the use, non-use, occupancy,<br>
condition, design, construction, maintenance, repair or rebuilding of any of, or otherwise relating<br>
to, the Premises or Adjoining Property, the failure to perform any of Tenant's obligations under<br>
this Lease, and any injury to or death of any person or persons or any loss of or damage to any<br>
property, real or personal, in any manner arising therefrom connected therewith or occurring<br>
thereon (collectively, &quot;Losses&quot;), whether or not any of the Indemnitees has or should have<br>
knowledge or notice of the defect or conditions, if any, causing or contributing to said Loss.  In<br>
case any action or proceeding is brought against any of the Indemnitees by reason of any such<br>
Loss, Tenant covenants upon notice from any of the Indemnitees to defend such Indemnitee in<br>
such action, with the expenses of such defense paid by Tenant, and such Indemnitee will<br>
cooperate and assist in the defense of such action or proceeding if reasonably requested so to do<br>
by Tenant.  The obligations of Tenant under this <U>Paragraph&nbsp;35</U> shall survive any termination of<br>
this Lease.<BR>

modification, amendment, discharge or waiver is sought.  Each of Tenant and Landlord agrees<br>
that it will not modify or amend this Lease without the written consent of Lender within any<br>
period during which there is a Lender hereunder.  In the event of any inconsistent instruction<br>
from Landlord and Lender, Tenant shall comply with instruction of Lender.<BR>
