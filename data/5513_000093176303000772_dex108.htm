Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 1995 (&#147;Plan&#148;) is sponsored by UnumProvident Corporation (&#147;Company&#148;) to provide its employees an those of its subsidiaries and affiliates an opportunity to share in the ownership of the parent
company, UnumProvident Corporation, by providing them with a convenient means for regular and systematic purchases of shares of the parent company&#146;s Common Stock, $0.10 par value (&#147;Stock&#148;), at favorable prices and on favorable terms,
and thus to develop a stronger incentive to work for continued success of the Company.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Plan is intended to qualify as an &#147;Employee Stock Purchase Plan&#148; under
Sections 421 and 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (&#147;Code&#148;). The provisions of the Plan will be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements of such sections of the Code.</font></p> <p style='
margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><b><font SIZE=2>ADMINISTRATION</font></b></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (&#147;Committee&#148;).
Members of the Committee are non-employee directors who are elected by the stockholders. Members of the Committee serve without fixed terms and are appointed or removed by the Board. The Committee has the power to make, amend, and repeal rules and
regulations for the interpretation and administration of the Plan.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Company reserves the right for the Committee to amend, suspend, or discontinue the Plan. No amendments will
be made without stockholder approval if such approval is required under any law or requirement of the stock exchange upon which the Stock is listed. Amendments to change the number of shares reserved for option under the Plan or to decrease the
option price may only be made with stockholder approval.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><b><font SIZE=2>STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN; TERM OF PLAN; PRORATION OF SHARES</font></b></p> <br><p

under the Plan through December 31, 2004. Stock subject to the Plan may be unissued shares, reacquired shares or shares bought on the open market for purposes of the Plan. If the total number of shares to be purchased by all participants in any
Option Period exceeds the number of shares set aside for the Plan, shares will be purchased only for the number of shares equal to a pro rata portion of the available number of shares. If this occurs, any remaining balance in a participant&#146;s
account will be returned to the participant. Whenever any change is made in Stock subject to the Plan or subject to deductions outstanding under the Plan (though merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split,
combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure, or otherwise), action will be taken by the Committee to adjust the number of shares subject to the Plan and the terms of options outstanding under the Plan.</font></p> <p

1, July 1, and October 1. Options to purchase shares under the Plan will be granted by the Company at the beginning of each period and are nontransferable by the employee. Each Purchase Period will end on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December
31, respectively. Options granted at the beginning of each Purchase Period will be exercised at the end of such Purchase Period. Unless the participating employee withdraws from the Plan (see &#147;WITHDRAWING FROM THE PLAN&#148;), whole and
fractional shares of Stock will automatically be purchased for such participating employee with the money withheld through payroll deductions during the period.</font></p> <br><p style='margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center'><font size=2>Page

tax law presently in effect, an employee is not taxed by reason of the purchase of shares received under the Plan. Since deductions for purchase of shares are made after taxes are withheld from pay, an employee will have no future income tax
obligation related to the Stock&#146;s value until sale, exchange or other lifetime transfer of legal title (such as a gift) of one or more shares of Stock (&#147;disposition&#148;). If a sales, exchange or other lifetime transfer occurs, the
federal income tax consequences will depend on whether the disposition occurs before or after the expiration of a period of at least one year after the ESPP Stock was purchased and two years after the beginning of the Purchase Period in which the
stock was purchased (&#147;Minimum Qualified Holding Period&#148;).</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>If an employee holds ESPP Stock for the Minimum Qualified Holding Period or if the employee dies, then for the

the amount paid for such Stock, or (2) the excess of the fair market value of such Stock at the beginning of the Purchase Period over the discounted price at the beginning of the Purchase Period. An amount equal to the amount realized as ordinary
income is added to an employee&#146;s basis of Stock purchased under this Plan for the purpose of determining the amount of any capital gain or loss resulting from the disposition. In the case of death, the basis of the stock in the hands of the
estate or heir is the fair market value of the stock on the date of the decedent&#146;s death or the alternate estate valuation date.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>If an employee has not held Stock purchased
