five-year payment guarantee and his bridge benefit is multiplied by a factor
which will make the resulting bridge benefit the Actuarial Equivalent of his
bridge benefit that without this guarantee would normally have terminated at
the earlier of his death or the limit date, as such term is defined in
paragraph 8.02&nbsp;(c).&quot;</p>
