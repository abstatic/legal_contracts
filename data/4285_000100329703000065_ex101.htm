  <p align="justify">During this period, the Plan was
amended on numerous occasions for the purpose of augmenting pensions, improving
pension benefits and implementing changes required by Applicable Pension

to restore the purchasing power of pensions and&nbsp; special augmentations of smaller
pensions. The bridge benefit was improved and options were added.&nbsp; Early retirement factors were significantly
improved for all Members.&nbsp; CAW Members had
their benefits defined by pension multipliers.&nbsp;
A new payment guarantee was added providing a 60% spousal with a 10 year
guarantee.&nbsp;
Several pension payment guarantees now apply as well to the bridge
benefit.&nbsp; A temporary contribution
holiday was granted to all active Members other than CAW Members.&nbsp; Finally, Member representation on the Pension
Committee was increased from two to four.&quot;</p>
