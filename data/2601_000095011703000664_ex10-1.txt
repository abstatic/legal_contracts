to (a) continue and restructure the existing loan facilities and provide for the
working capital needs of the Borrowers, (b) increase the maximum principal
amount of the Commitment to $50,000,000 ($10,000,000 of which may be requested
as Letters of Credit), (c) reinstate the Mortgage Loans extended under this
Agreement (which Mortgage Loans are secured by the Plainview Mortgage), (d)
confirm and continue the indebtedness, other obligations and security interests
created under the Existing Loan Agreement and other Existing Loan Instruments,
(e) provide for, continue, add to and fully restate (as amended hereby)

and now referred to as "Dow Jones") page 3750 as of 11:00 A.M. London time on
the day that is two London Business Days preceding the first day of such Fixed
Rate Loan; provided, however, if the rate described above does not appear on the
Dow Jones System on any applicable interest determination date, Adjusted LIBO
Rate shall be the rate (rounded upward, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a percentage point), determined on the basis of the
offered rates for deposits in dollars for a period substantially equal to the
Interest Period on the Reuters Page "LIBO" (or such other page as may replace
the LIBO Page on that service for the purpose of displaying such rates), as of
11:00 A.M.(London Time), on the day that is two (2) London Business Days prior
to the beginning of such Interest Period. If both the Dow Jones and Reuters
system are unavailable, then the rate for that date will be determined on the
basis of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of time
comparable to such Fixed Rate Loan which are offered by four major banks in the
London interbank market at approximately 11:00 A.M. London time, on the day that
is two (2) London Business Days preceding the first day of such Fixed Rate Loan
as selected by the Administrative Agent (at the direction of Fleet). The
principal London office of each of the four major London banks will be requested
to provide a quotation of its U.S. dollar deposit offered rate. If at least two
such quotations are provided, the rate for the date will be the arithmetic mean
of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the
rate for that date will be determined on the basis of the rates quoted for loans
in U.S. dollars to leading European banks for a period of time comparable to
such Fixed Rate Loan offered by major banks in New York City at approximately
11:00 A.M. New York City time, on the day that is two London Business Days
preceding the first day of such Fixed Rate Loan. In the event that the
Administrative Agent is unable to obtain any such quotation as provided above,
it will be deemed that Adjusted LIBO Rate pursuant to a Fixed Rate Loan cannot
be determined. In the event that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System shall impose a Reserve Percentage with respect to LIBOR deposits of any
Bank, then for any period during which such Reserve Percentage shall apply,
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be equal to the amount determined above divided by an
amount equal to 1 minus the Reserve Percentage.

          "Adjustment Items" shall mean, as to any period of determination,

restructuring charges incurred in the Borrowers' 2002 fiscal year, allocated
$5,050,000 in the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2002 and $10,590,000 in the

                      Amounts and Terms of the Obligations

          Section 2.01. The Revolving Credit Loans.

          (a) Upon the terms and provisions and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, each Bank shall make revolving credit loans (with
all such loans by the Banks being referred to collectively as the "Revolving
Credit Loans") from time to time during the Revolving Credit Period to the
Borrowers at their request (as provided in subsection (b), below); provided that
no Bank shall be required to make any Revolving Credit Loan if, (i) after giving
effect to the Revolving Credit Loan to be made the aggregate then outstanding
Extensions of Credit owing to such Bank (including such Bank's Pro Rata Share of
the Letter of Credit Amount, but excluding such Bank's Mortgage Loans) would
exceed such Bank's Committed Share of the Commitment, or (ii) the sum of (A) the
face amount of the Revolving Credit Loan to be made, plus (B) the Letter of
Credit Amount, plus (C) the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving
Credit Loans, would exceed the Commitment. Subject to the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, during the Revolving Credit Period the Borrowers may reborrow
Advances previously repaid by them.

          (b) Aeroflex (without notice to or the consent of any other Borrower)
from time to time may request an advance of Revolving Credit Loans from all of
the Banks pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section (as made by the Banks, an
"Advance") by giving the Banks a signed notice of its request, or by giving the
Banks notice of its request both by telephone and telecopy of a signed notice
and promptly confirming its request by delivery to each Bank of an original copy
of the signed notice. The notice requesting an Advance (i) may be combined with
a request under Section 2.01(b) hereof that all or a portion of the Advance bear
interest at a Fixed Rate when made, (ii) shall be delivered to the Banks no
later than 11:00 A.M. (New York city time) on the requested Advance Date in the
case of requests for Base Rate Loans and at least three Business Day prior to
the requested Advance Date in the case of requests for Fixed Rate Loans (as more
fully provided in the case of Fixed Rate Loans under Section 2.04(c) hereof),
(iii) shall be deemed to have been delivered on the following Business Day
unless actually received by each of the Banks prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on a Business Day, (iv)


                                      -27-




<PAGE>



shall be irrevocable once given, and (v) shall specify (A) the requested Advance
Date, (B) the principal amount of the requested Advance and (C) the amount to be
advanced by each Bank in accordance with its Committed Share. Each requested
Advance shall be for an integral multiple of $50,000 in an amount that is not
less than $250,000 in the case of Base Rate Loans or such larger multiple and
minimum amounts as is required under Section 2.04(b) hereof if the Advance is to
bear interest at a Fixed Rate. Subject to compliance with the terms and
provisions of Article IV of this Agreement, each Bank shall make its Committed
Share of the requested Advance on the proposed Advance Date by crediting the
demand deposit account maintained by Aeroflex with such Bank at its office at
the address set forth in the Introduction.

          (c) Aeroflex (without notice to or the consent of any other Borrower)
may voluntarily elect to permanently reduce the Commitment in whole at any time,
or in part from time to time in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in an amount
that is not less than $5,000,000, by giving the Banks a signed notice of its
election, or by giving the Banks notice of its election both by telephone and
telecopy of a signed notice and promptly confirming its election by delivery to
each Bank of an original copy of the signed notice; provided however that no
such reduction shall be made that would result in the payment or prepayment of
any portion of any Fixed Rate Loan unless the Borrowers repay such Fixed Rate
Loan in full and concurrently pay all amounts (if any) required under Section
2.04(i) hereof. Notice of such reduction election (i) shall be delivered to the
Banks at least five Business Days prior to the requested reduction date, (ii)
shall be deemed to have been delivered on the following Business Day unless
actually received by each of the Banks prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time)
on a Business Day and (iii) shall be irrevocable once given. The Borrowers
shall, prior to 11:00 a.m. on the requested reduction date, make a prepayment of
the Revolving Credit Loans in the amount, if any, necessary to make the
aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans, after
giving effect to the prepayment, not more than the Commitment (as so reduced).

          Section 2.02. Mortgage Loans.

          The Borrowers hereby acknowledge, certify and agree that: (i) pursuant
to the Existing Loan Agreement, the Banks have made mortgage loans to the
Borrowers that are outstanding as of February 1, 2003 in the aggregate principal
amount of $3,225,333.33 (the "Mortgage Loans"); (ii) the obligations of the
Borrowers to repay the Mortgage Loans (with interest) to the Banks and to
perform or otherwise satisfy their other obligations under the Existing Loan
Agreement and other Existing Loan Instruments are not subject as of the date of
this Agreement to any defense, counterclaim, setoff, right of recoupment,
abatement, reduction or other claim or determination; and (iii) upon the terms
and provisions and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the
Mortgage Loans shall continue and be subject to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, which agreement, upon the Effective Date, has amended, restated and
completely replaced the Existing Loan Agreement. Each Bank shall continue to
share in the Mortgage Loans in accordance with its Committed Share.

          Section 2.03. The Notes.

          (a) The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Revolving Credit
Loans, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Sixth Amended and
Restated Revolving Promissory Note issued by the Borrowers to each Bank in the
form of Exhibit A hereto in the amount of such Bank's Committed Share of the
Commitment and dated as of the date hereof. The Revolving Credit Notes have been
issued to amend, extend, restate and completely replace the Existing Notes, to
evidence all amounts outstanding under the Existing Notes and to evidence any
further advances or readvances of the Revolving Credit Loans. Although issued in
substitution for and restatement and replacement of the Existing Notes, the
Notes shall not be deemed to have been issued in payment, satisfaction,
cancellation or novation of the Existing Notes. The Banks shall be entitled to
retain the Existing Notes until all of the


                                      -28-




<PAGE>



Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied, after which time the Existing
Notes shall be returned to the Borrowers at the same time as the Notes, unless
some other time or manner of delivery shall be provided by any other written
agreement between the Borrowers and the Banks.

          (b) The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Mortgage Loans,
together with interest thereon, shall continue to be evidenced by the Mortgage
Note issued by the Borrowers to each Bank pursuant to the Existing Loan
Agreement, a copy of one or more of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

          Section 2.04. Interest; Optional Fixed Rates; Additional Required
Payments.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Loans shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year
of 360 days) on the unpaid principal balance of those Loans outstanding from
time to time, from and including the date of Advance until such principal
balance of such Loans is repaid in full (including, without limitation, any and
all interest and other amounts accrued during the pendency of any bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or other similar proceedings, irrespective of whether
such interest and other amounts are allowed or allowable as claims in such
proceedings), at a fluctuating annual rate that for the Pro Rata Share of the
Loans of each Bank shall be equal to the Base Rate, which fluctuating rate shall
change from time to time simultaneously with each corresponding change in the
Base Rate. Interest on those Loans shall be payable by the Borrowers in arrears:
(i) prior to the relevant Maturity Date, on each Interest Payment Date; (ii) in
full on the relevant Maturity Date; and (iii) on demand after the relevant
Maturity Date.

          (b) The Borrowers from time to time may request that a portion of the
Loans outstanding bear interest at the Applicable Euro Rate for an Interest
Period of one, two, three or six months, which portion must be in an integral
multiple of $100,000 in an amount that is not less than $2,500,000. Any portion
or portions of the Loans for which a Fixed Rate is in effect shall bear interest
for the applicable Interest Period (computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed and a year of 360 days) at an annual rate equal to the
corresponding Fixed Rate(s). Interest on the Fixed Rate Loans shall be payable
by the Borrowers in arrears: (i) prior to the relevant Maturity Date, on each
Interest Payment Date; (ii) in full on the relevant Maturity Date; and (iii) on
demand after the relevant Maturity Date.

          (c) The Borrowers may elect to have a Fixed Rate apply by giving the
Banks a signed notice of their election, or by giving the Banks notice of their
election both by telephone and telecopy of a signed notice and promptly
confirming their election by delivery to each Bank of an original copy of the
signed notice. The notice electing a Fixed Rate (i) may be combined with a
request under Section 2.01(b) hereof for an Advance, (ii) shall be delivered to
the Banks no less than three Business Days prior to commencement of a designated
Interest Period at the Applicable Euro Rate, (iii) shall be deemed to have been
delivered on the following Business Day unless actually received by each of the
Banks prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on a Business Day, (iv) shall be
irrevocable once given, and (v) shall specify the requested Fixed Rate, date of
commencement, duration of Interest Period and portion of the Loans to which the
Fixed Rate is to apply. The election by the Borrowers of a Fixed Rate is
conditioned upon each of the following:

     (A)  no more than six (6) Interest Periods shall be in effect at any one
          time unless the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Banks
          participating in such Loans) in its discretion shall consent
          otherwise;

     (B)  the portion(s) of the Loans subject to a Fixed Rate(s) shall not
          exceed an amount equal to the remainder of (1) the principal balance
          of the Loans outstanding on the date such


                                      -29-




<PAGE>



          Fixed Rate(s) would commence (including any concurrent Advance), minus
          (2) those portions thereof that are scheduled to be paid as set forth
          in Section 2.05 hereof within the requested Interest Period(s);

     (C)  no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be then
          continuing; and

     (D)  no adverse determination shall have been made by any Bank pursuant to
          subsection (e) of this Section.

From and after the last day of any Interest Period, interest shall accrue at the
rate based upon the Base Rate (as provided in subsection (a) of this Section)
until that portion of the principal balance is repaid or a new Fixed Rate with
respect thereto is adopted hereunder. If any Interest Period ends on a day other
than a Business Day, such Interest Period shall be extended to the next
succeeding day that is a Business Day unless (in the case of a Loan bearing
interest at the Applicable Euro Rate) such succeeding day would fall in the next
calendar month, in which event such Interest Period shall end on the immediately
preceding Business Day.

          (d) In addition to the payment of interest as stated above, (i) in the
event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the
principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment, (ii) in the event of any conversion of any Fixed Rate
Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, or in the event
of the conversion of any Base Rate Loan into a Fixed Rate Loan, accrued interest
on each such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion, and
(iii) if there shall be any increase in the direct or indirect costs to any one
or more of the Banks of lending, funding or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan, or
any reduction in any amount received or to be received by any one or more of the
Banks hereunder, due to:

     (A)  the introduction of or any change in any Applicable Law or the
          interpretation or administration thereof, including (without
          limitation) the imposition, modification or application of, or
          increase in, (1) any reserve, capital adequacy, special deposit,
          assessment or similar requirements, (2) any requirement to withhold or
          deduct from any amount payable to any one or more of the Banks any
          taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, deductions, withholdings or
          charges of a similar nature (other than federal, state and local
          income and franchise taxes imposed upon any Bank), or any interest
          thereon or any penalties with respect thereto, imposed, levied,
          collected, assessed, withheld or deducted by any Authority, including
          subdivisions and taxing authorities thereof, or (3) any other
          restriction or condition affecting a Fixed Rate or this Agreement;

     (B)  the compliance by any one or more of the Banks with any regulation,
          guideline or request from any central bank or other Authority (whether
          or not having the force of law);

then the Borrowers from time to time, upon demand by the Administrative Agent,
shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of each affected Bank)
additional amounts sufficient to indemnify each such Bank against and reimburse
each such Bank for such increased costs and reduced receipts (but only to the
extent each such increased cost or reduced receipt has not already been included
in the calculation of any interest rate or fee or otherwise reimbursed under any
other section of this Agreement), including (without limitation) amounts
sufficient to compensate each affected Bank for any breakage or other costs and
any decrease in margin or other return incurred in connection with the
repayment, prepayment or other reduction of any Fixed Rate Loan and the
liquidation or redeployment of the affected deposits or other funding
arrangements. A certificate as to the amount of such increased costs and reduced
receipts submitted to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent (which may be
the certificate of each relevant Bank) shall be conclusive as to the existence
and amount thereof absent manifest error. If


                                      -30-




<PAGE>



the Administrative Agent has not received payment for such amounts within five
(5) Business Days of the date of such certificate, the Administrative Agent
(with the consent of the Majority Banks) may direct the application of all or a
portion of the next succeeding payment or prepayment made by the Borrowers,
whether intended by the Borrowers to be interest, principal or otherwise, first
to the reduction of the amounts of such increased costs and reduced receipts.

          (e) If, on or before the date of commencement of any Interest Period,
any one or more of the Banks shall have determined (which determination shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Borrowers) that (i) it is impermissible for
such Bank to make any Fixed Rate Loan due to any of the circumstances described
in clauses (A) and (B) of subsection (d) of this Section, (ii) deposits in
United States Dollars in amounts equal to the portion of the Loans to be subject
to a Fixed Rate for that Interest Period are not being offered to such Banks in
the applicable market, (iii) by reason of changes affecting the applicable
market, the Fixed Rate to be in effect for that period will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of maintaining for that period the portion
of the Loans for which the Fixed Rate was requested, or (iv) the Fixed Rate or
requested Interest Period is otherwise unavailable, then the portion of the
Loans so affected shall bear interest based upon the Base Rate as provided in
subsection (a) of this Section. Furthermore, if any one or more of the Banks
shall have determined (which determination shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the Borrowers) that it is impermissible for such Bank(s) to
continue any Fixed Rate Loan during the relevant Interest Period due to any of
the circumstances described in clauses (A) and (B) of subsection (d) of this
Section, then (A) that Interest Period shall be deemed to have been terminated
as of the date specified in that determination, (B) the Borrowers shall
indemnify each such Bank against and reimburse each such Bank for any increased
costs or reduced receipts relating to that termination as provided in
subsections (d) and (f) of this Section as if there had been a voluntary
prepayment of that Fixed Rate Loan by the Borrowers, and (C) after the date
specified in that determination, the portion of the Loans so affected shall bear
interest based upon the Base Rate as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers in the event any Bank makes
such a determination; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of that determination or the continued accrual of
interest based upon the Base Rate on the applicable portion of the Loans.

          (f) In addition to the payment of interest or fees under this
Agreement, if one or more of the Banks or any of their respective affiliates
determines or has determined that (i) compliance with any existing or future
Applicable Law, including (without limitation) any regulation, guideline or
request from any central bank or other Authority (whether or not having the
force of law), or any change therein or in the interpretation or administration
thereof, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to
be maintained by such Bank(s) or affiliate(s) (taking into account its policies
with respect to capital adequacy and desired rate of return on capital), and
(ii) the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon any commitment or
funding to the Borrowers or any other obligation of such Bank or affiliate(s)
under or related to this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument (using such
averaging, attribution and allocation methods as each affected Bank may
reasonably deem appropriate), then the Borrowers from time to time, upon demand
by the affected Bank(s), shall pay to the affected Bank(s) additional amounts
sufficient to compensate the affected Bank(s) for those circumstances (without,
however, duplicating any amount paid by the Borrowers pursuant to subsection (d)
of this Section). A certificate as to the amount of such compensation submitted
to the Borrowers by the affected Bank(s) or affiliate shall be conclusive as to
the existence and amount thereof absent manifest error. If the Administrative
Agent has not received payment for such amounts within five (5) Business Days of
the date of such certificate, the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the
Majority Banks) may direct the application of all or a portion of the next
succeeding payment or prepayment made by the Borrowers, whether intended by the
Borrowers to be interest, principal or otherwise, first to the reduction of such
billed amount.


                                      -31-




<PAGE>



          (g) Upon and following an Event of Default, all Loans, any and all
accrued and unpaid interest, fee or amount due hereunder and all other
Obligations, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall bear interest
(payable on demand, and in any event on the last day of each month, and computed
daily on the basis of a 360-day year for actual days elapsed) at the Default
Rate until paid. In no event, however, shall interest payable hereunder be in
excess of the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law. The
obligation to so pay interest upon any obligation of any Borrower to the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and/or the Banks shall not be construed
so as to waive the requirement for payment on the same date that payment is to
be made to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and/or the Banks as set
forth in this Agreement.

          (h) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (i) The Borrowers shall pay to each Bank, upon request of a Bank, such
amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or expense incurred as a result of:
(i) any payment of a Fixed Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the
Interest Period for such Fixed Rate Loan; (ii) any failure by a Borrower to
borrow a Fixed Rate Loan on the date specified by the Borrowers' written notice
for the Interest Period therein specified, other than as a result of a Bank's
determination not to make such Fixed Rate Loan; (iii) any failure of a Borrower
to pay a Fixed Rate Loan on the date for payment specified in Borrowers' written
notice (each of the events set forth in (i) through (iii) above is referred to
as a "Breakage Event" and each Loan affected by any of the events specified in
(i) through (iii) above is referred to as an "Affected Loan"). Without limiting
the foregoing, the Borrowers shall pay to such Bank a "yield maintenance fee" in
an amount computed as follows: The current rate for United States Treasury
securities (bills on a discounted basis shall be converted to a bond equivalent)
with a maturity date closest to the Interest Period of the Affected Loan, shall
be subtracted from the Fixed Rate in effect at the time of the Breakage Event.
If the result is zero or a negative number, there shall be no yield maintenance
fee. If the result is a positive number, then the resulting percentage shall be
multiplied by the amount of the principal balance of the Affected Loan. The
resulting amount shall be divided by 360 and multiplied by the number of days
remaining in the Interest Period of the Affected Loan. Said amount shall be
reduced to present value calculated by using the above referenced United States
Treasury securities rate and the number of days remaining in the Interest Period
of the Affected Loan. The resulting amount shall be the yield maintenance fee
due to such Bank upon the occurrence of a Breakage Event. If by reason of an
Event of Default, the Administrative Agent declares the Loans and/or the Notes
to be immediately due and payable, then any yield maintenance fee with respect
to a Fixed Rate Loan shall become due and payable in the same manner as though
the Borrowers have prepaid a Fixed Rate Loan on the date of such declaration.

          Section 2.05. Voluntary and Mandatory Payments.

          (a) The Borrowers may voluntarily elect to prepay the Loans in full at
any time, or in part from time to time in integral multiples of (x) $500,000 in
an amount that is not less than $500,000 in the case of Base Rate Loans and (y)
$1,000,000 in an amount that is not less than $1,000,000 in the case of Fixed
Rate Loans, in either case without premium or penalty or reduction of the
Commitment, by giving the Banks a signed notice of their election, or by giving
the Banks notice of their election both by telephone and telecopy of a signed
notice and promptly confirming their election by delivery to each Bank of an
original copy of the signed notice; provided that (1) the Borrowers shall not in
any event prepay any portion of any Fixed Rate Loan unless the Borrowers prepay
such Fixed Rate Loan in full and concurrently pay all amounts (if any) required
under Section 2.04(i) hereof and (2) the Borrowers may not voluntarily prepay
any portion of the Mortgage Loans prior to the relevant Maturity Date so long as
any principal balance remains outstanding under the Revolving Credit Loans.
Notice of such prepayment election (i) shall be delivered to the Banks at least
three Business Days prior to the requested prepayment


                                      -32-




<PAGE>



date of a Fixed Rate Loans and up to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the same
Business Day of the requested prepayment date of a Base Rate Loan, (ii) shall be
deemed to have been delivered on the following Business Day unless actually
received by each of the Banks prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on a
Business Day, and (iii) shall be irrevocable once given. The Borrowers shall
repay the Loans on the date and in the amount specified in such notice of
prepayment election. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, and except as
the Borrowers may otherwise request with respect to any voluntary prepayment,
each voluntary or mandatory prepayment shall be applied first to the outstanding
balance of the Revolving Credit Loans, with any excess then applied to the
Mortgage Loans. So long as any principal balance remains outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Loans, any attempted prepayment of the Mortgage Loans (A) shall
be applied to and deemed and construed to have reduced the Revolving Credit
Loans and (B) shall not be applied against or deemed or construed to have
reduced the Mortgage Loans.

          (b) The Borrowers shall repay the Revolving Credit Loans immediately
at any time and from time to time in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of
(i) the sum of (A) the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit
Loans, plus (B) the Letter of Credit Amount, over (ii) the Commitment. In the
event the Letter of Credit Amount alone exceeds the Commitment, then the
Borrowers immediately shall repay the Revolving Credit Loans in full and deposit
cash collateral with the Administrative Agent or its designee in an amount equal
to the remaining deficiency (which collateral shall be deposited and
administered in the manner contemplated in Section 8.02(d) hereof).

          (c) The Borrowers shall repay the principal balances then outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Loans in full on the relevant Maturity Date.

          (d) The Borrowers shall continue to repay the Mortgage Loans, in
monthly installments of $26,222.22 each on the last Business Day of each
calendar month (which payments commenced as provided in the Existing Loan
Agreement) until the relevant Maturity Date. The Borrowers shall repay the
principal balance then outstanding under the Mortgage Loans in full on the
relevant Maturity Date.

          (e) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, and without in any way limiting the
applicability of the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments in respect of any Collateral or any of the other Loans or other
Obligations of the Borrowers, the Borrowers acknowledge and agree that: (i) any
Letter of Credit Advance, if not paid on the date specified in Section 2.07(d)
(as a result of which non-payment it is deemed converted into a Revolving Credit
Loan), or any reimbursable amount or expense or other advance that is not
described elsewhere in this Section and for which no due date or time period for
payment is specified in this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, together
with interest thereon as provided in Section 2.04, shall be due (or in the case
of an unreimbursed Letter of Credit Advance, overdue) and payable on demand; and
(ii) the representations, warranties, covenants and other terms and provisions
set forth in this Agreement and in the other Loan Instruments are not intended
and shall not be deemed or construed to limit the demand nature of the
Obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any Letter of Credit Advance or any
reimbursable amount, expense or other advance hereunder and thereunder.

          (g) Nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed or construed to
be a waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement respecting the
reimbursement of any increased costs or reduced receipts of any Bank in the
event of any prepayment or repayment (whether mandatory or otherwise) of any
portion of any of the Fixed Rate Loans.


                                      -33-

          (h) The Obligations then outstanding shall be due and payable in full
on the relevant Maturity Date, and to the extent arising thereafter shall be due
and payable on demand, in either event notwithstanding anything in this Article
to the contrary.

          Section 2.06. Commitment Fee; Restructure Fee; Administration Fee;
Etc.

          (a) The Borrowers shall pay to the Banks sharing in the Revolving
Credit Loans on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December of each year during the Revolving Credit Period, and on the last day of
the Revolving Credit Period, in arrears, a fee (computed on the basis of the
actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days) respecting the
availability of the Commitment (the "Commitment Fee") equal to the Applicable
Percentage per annum of the average daily unadvanced portion of the Commitment
during the then most recently concluded calendar quarter or portion thereof
(with the Letter of Credit Amount being considered an advance under the
Commitment). It is expressly agreed that regardless of when the Effective Date
occurs, the Commitment Fee shall begin to accrue on the earlier of the Effective
Date and March 1, 2003.

          (b) The Borrowers shall pay to the Banks a nonrefundable fee
respecting the restructuring of the current loan facilities of the Borrowers
equal to $125,000 (the "Facility Fee") payable at execution of this Agreement to
the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Banks.

          Section 2.07. Letters of Credit.

          (a) Upon the terms and provisions and subject to the conditions
contained in this Agreement, in lieu of a cash advance under the Commitment the
Fronting Bank shall issue or cause the issuance of Letters of Credit from time
to time upon the request of the Borrowers up to a cumulative maximum face amount
(whether or not advanced) not to exceed $10,000,000 in order to secure the debts
or obligations of the Borrowers; provided that (i) the Fronting Bank shall not
be required to issue any Letter of Credit if the requested Letter of Credit or
the issuance thereof would not reasonably be in accordance with the Fronting
Bank's standard guidelines and procedures, (ii) the Fronting Bank's agreement to
issue Letters of Credit shall terminate on the first to occur of the relevant
Maturity Date and the expiration of the Revolving Credit Period; and (iii) the
Fronting Bank shall not issue any Letter of Credit if (to the actual knowledge
of the Fronting Bank) (A) after giving effect to the Letter of Credit to be
issued the aggregate then outstanding Extensions of Credit owing to any Bank
(including each Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Letter of Credit Amount, but
excluding each Bank's Mortgage Loans) would exceed any Bank's Committed Share of
the Commitment, or (B) the sum of (x) the face amount of the Letter of Credit to
be issued, plus (y) the Letter of Credit Amount, plus (z) the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loans, would exceed the Commitment.
Letters of Credit may be issued for purposes consistent with the historical
practices of the Borrowers in the ordinary course of their respective
businesses.

          (b) The Borrowers may request that a Letter of Credit be issued
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section by giving the Fronting Bank (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent if not the Fronting Bank) a signed notice of
their request, or by giving the Fronting Bank notice of their request both by
telephone and telecopy of a signed notice and promptly confirming their request
by delivery to the Fronting Bank of an original copy of the signed notice (with
copies of such telecopy and notice to the Administrative Agent if not the
Fronting Bank). The notice requesting a Letter of Credit (i) shall be delivered
to the Fronting Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the
Fronting Bank) at least three Business Days prior to the requested Issuance
Date, (ii) shall be deemed to have been delivered on the following Business Day
unless actually received by the Fronting Bank prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on a Business Day, (iii) shall be irrevocable once given, and (iv) shall
specify (A) the requested Issuance Date, face amount and expiration date of the
desired Letter of Credit, (B) the


                                      -34-




<PAGE>



beneficiary to whom it is to be issued (each, a "Letter of Credit Beneficiary"),
and (C) the purpose for which the Letter of Credit is being requested. On or
before the requested Issuance Date, the Borrowers also must complete and deliver
to the Fronting Bank an application for each requested Letter of Credit in form
and substance acceptable to the Fronting Bank and issuer and pay the issuer's
normal application and issuance fees for each requested Letter of Credit. Each
requested Letter of Credit shall be in a face amount of not less than $10,000
and shall terminate no later than the scheduled expiration of the Revolving
Credit Period. The issuance of each Letter of Credit is subject to compliance on
the Issuance Date with the conditions precedent to obtaining an Advance under
this Agreement and subject always to the sole and absolute discretion of the
Fronting Bank. Each Letter of Credit will be issued on a standard form of the
issuing bank then in effect. Each Letter of Credit shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with: (i) the International Standby Practice; and (ii)
to the extent the International Standby Practice is not dispositive, the
Applicable Laws pertaining in the State of New York (including the Uniform
Commercial Code). The requested Letter of Credit may be delivered by the
Fronting Bank to the Letter of Credit Beneficiary, to the Borrowers or to such
other person as the Borrowers reasonably may request. The Letters of Credit may
not be transferred or assigned without (i) the prior written consent of the
Fronting Bank and issuer, (ii) submission to the Fronting Bank of a notice of
transfer in the form annexed to the Letter of Credit, and (iii) the payment of
the issuer's normal transfer fee.

          (c) Each of the Letters of Credit may be drawn upon by presentment to
the Fronting Bank, at its office at 1 Fleet Way, Scranton, Pennsylvania 18507,
Attention: Global Trade Operations Standby Unit (or such other office as may be
specified therein), of the original Letter of Credit, duly endorsed by the
Letter of Credit Beneficiary (which presentment may be waived by the Fronting
Bank with respect to Letters of Credit permitting multiple drawings), together
with a sight draft payable to the Letter of Credit Beneficiary or its order and
the Letter of Credit Beneficiary's certificate that it is entitled to the amount
of the sight draft as a result of nonpayment of the obligations thereby secured,
each substantially in the form annexed to the relevant Letter of Credit. The
promissory note or other instrument evidencing the obligation thereby secured,
duly endorsed to the Fronting Bank, also shall be presented with the Letter of
Credit if that obligation will be paid in full as a result of the payment in
accordance with the Letter of Credit. If the relevant note or other instrument w
ill not be so paid in full, the Fronting Bank (in its sole and absolute
discretion) may require that the person presenting the Letter of Credit present
it to the Fronting Bank for copying and return. The Fronting Bank and/or issuer
may accept any draft, certificate or other document reasonably conforming in
form and substance to the requirements described in the Letter of Credit and the
forms annexed thereto, and may afford the Letter of Credit Beneficiary notice of
and an opportunity to correct nonconforming items capable of cure, each in the
sole and absolute discretion of the Fronting Bank and/or issuer and without any
notice to or assent from any Borrower. The Fronting Bank, any other issuer and
their respective Representatives may in good faith (without inquiry) with
respect to a particular Letter of Credit: (i) act in reliance upon any written,
telegraphic, facsimile, electronic, telephonic, oral or other request, notice or
communication reasonably believed to be from, by, on behalf of or authorized by
any Borrower, the Beneficiary or their respective Representatives, successors or
assigns, whether or not from or signed by an authorized person; (ii) accept or
pay as complying with the terms of the relevant Letter of Credit any drafts or
other documents that appear on their face (A) to be reasonably conforming to the
required forms or (B) to be issued or signed by the Beneficiary or other proper
party or their respective Representatives, successors or assigns (including,
without limitation, any bankruptcy trustee or similar official); (iii) reject
any presentment, draft or other document that it determines (in its sole and
absolute discretion) to not conform to the requirements of the Letter of Credit
or this Agreement; or (iv) act or refrain from acting in reliance upon or in
accordance with the International Standby Practice, Applicable Law or customary
practices in effect in the place of issuance, confirmation, presentment,
negotiation or payment of the Letter of Credit.

          (d) Each amount paid by the Fronting Bank or its designee pursuant to
a Letter of Credit or otherwise in respect of the obligation thereby secured (a
"Letter of Credit Advance") shall be


                                      -35-




<PAGE>



repaid by the Borrowers to the Fronting Bank on the same day payment is made by
the Fronting Bank or its designee. If a Letter of Credit Advance is not so
repaid (without, however, in any way consenting to such non-payment), (i) such
Letter of Credit Advance shall be deemed to be an Advance of a Revolving Credit
Loan (as provided in Section 9.03 hereof) and shall be repayable ON DEMAND,
together with interest thereon at the rate specified in this Article for overdue
payments of the Loans, pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement
notwithstanding any term or provision contained in any Letter of Credit
application to the contrary, and (ii) the resulting default shall not be deemed
or construed to have been cured until payment has been duly made. Nothing in
this subsection, however, is intended to limit the ability of the Borrowers to
request an Advance prior to an anticipated Letter of Credit payment date or
(assuming satisfaction of the requisite conditions) to apply the proceeds
thereof to the payment of a Letter of Credit Advance.

          (e) The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of all of the Banks) a fee respecting each Letter of Credit (the "Letter
of Credit Fee") for the year commencing with that date at a per annum rate
(computed on the basis of the actual number of days in such year and a year of
360 days) equal to the Applicable Euro Margin Rate for Revolving Credit Loans of
the unadvanced face amount thereof. The Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable on
the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December of each year
during the Revolving Credit Period, and on the last day of the Revolving Credit
Period, in each case in arrears; provided that the minimum fee for any Letter of
Credit shall be the greater of (i) one-half percent (0.50%) of the face amount
or (ii) $1,000, irrespective of any smaller face amount or shorter expiry. The
Borrowers also shall pay to the Fronting Bank for its own account any and all
customary fees (without duplication of the Letter of Credit Fee), commissions
and/or charges of the Fronting Bank for any issuance, payment, acceptance,
processing, increase, extension, renewal, amendment and/or transfer of the
Letter of Credit, all in accordance with the Fronting Bank's customary
practices, as established by the Fronting Bank in its sole discretion from time
to time. The Borrowers also shall pay to the Fronting Bank for its own account
any fees or other charges of any other issuer or any participant, correspondent,
confirming bank, custodian or designee of the Fronting Bank or other issuer
involved with the Letter of Credit.

          (f) In addition to the payments of principal, interest and fees as
stated above, if there shall be any increase in the direct or indirect costs to
any one or more of the Banks of issuing, causing the issuance of or maintaining
a Letter of Credit, or any reduction in any amount received or to be received
with respect to a Letter of Credit by any one or more of the Banks hereunder,
due to:

          (i) the introduction of or any change in any Applicable Law or the
     interpretation or administration thereof, including (without limitation)
     the imposition, modification or application of (A) any reserve, capital
     adequacy, special deposit, assessment or similar requirement respecting
     Letters of Credit issued by, assets held by, or deposits in or for the
     account of any one or more of the Banks or other issuer(s) of a Letter of
     Credit, (B) any requirement to withhold or deduct from any amount payable
     to any one or more of the Banks hereunder, or payable directly or
     indirectly to the issuer of a Letter of Credit, any taxes, levies, imposts,
     duties, fees, deductions, withholdings or charges of a similar nature
     (other than federal, state and local income and franchise taxes imposed
     upon any Bank), or any interest thereon or any penalties with respect
     thereto, imposed, levied, collected, assessed, withheld or deducted by any
     governmental Authority, including subdivisions and taxing authorities
     thereof, or (C) any other restriction or condition affecting a Letter of
     Credit or this Agreement; or

          (ii) the compliance by any one of more of the Banks or other issuer(s)
     of a Letter of Credit with any regulation, guideline or request from any
     central bank or other Authority (whether or not having the force of law);


                                      -36-




<PAGE>



then the Borrowers from time to time, upon demand by the Administrative Agent,
shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of each affected Bank or
other issuer) additional amounts sufficient to indemnify each such Bank or other
issuer against and reimburse each such Bank or other issuer for such increased
costs and reduced receipts (but only to the extent each such increased cost or
reduced receipt has not already been included in the calculation of any interest
rate or fee or otherwise reimbursed under any other section of this Agreement).
A certificate as to the amount of such increased costs and reduced receipts
submitted to the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent (which may be the
certificate of each affected Bank or other issuer) shall be conclusive as to the
existence and amount thereof absent manifest error. If the Administrative Agent
has not received payment for such amounts by the time it receives from the
Borrowers the next succeeding payment or prepayment of a portion of the
Obligations, whether intended by the Borrowers to be interest, principal or
otherwise, the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Majority Banks) may
apply such payment or prepayment first to the reduction of the amounts of such
costs and receipts.

          (g) The Obligations shall not otherwise be deemed to have been fully
paid or satisfied until all of the Letters of Credit have been paid (and the
corresponding Letter of Credit Advances repaid by the Borrowers) or have been
surrendered to the Fronting Bank or the Administrative Agent for return to and
cancellation by the issuer(s) thereof; provided that any Letter of Credit that
has not been presented for payment shall be deemed for this purpose to have been
canceled on the thirtieth day following the stated expiry date, without,
however, relieving the Borrowers of any of the Obligations with respect to any
such Letter of Credit that is in the process of payment.

          (h) In addition to the payment of fees and other amounts as stated
above, after notice from the Administrative Agent during the continuance of any
Event of Default prior to maturity, and at all times on and after the Maturity
Date, the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of
all of the Banks) interest in respect of the Letters of Credit outstanding from
time to time during such period(s) at the Default Rate, which amounts shall be
payable by the Borrowers at the same times as the regular interest payments on
the Loans required by Section 2.04 of this Agreement, subject, however, to the
maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law as provided in Section 2.11 hereof.

Each of the payment obligations, covenants and other obligations and agreements
of the Borrowers contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments
shall be paid and satisfied by the Borrowers strictly in accordance with their
terms in each case without regard to any of the following: none of the Fronting
Bank, any other issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Bank and their respective
Representatives shall have any liability or responsibility for any of the
following; and each Borrower hereby expressly waives any claim or defense
against or in respect of each such person with respect to any and all of the
following: (i) any payment or other action or inaction under or with respect to
any Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms and provisions of the relevant
Letter of Credit, this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument; (ii) any payment
against presentation of any required draft or other document that does not
reference, or incompletely or incorrectly references, the existence, amount,
date, number or other aspect of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) any
presentment or payment under or with respect to any Letter of Credit after the
expiry thereof in reliance upon or in accordance with the International Standby
Practice, Applicable Law or customary practices in effect in the place of
issuance, confirmation, presentment, negotiation or payment of the Letter of
Credit; (iv) the form, validity, sufficiency, completeness, accuracy,
genuineness or legal effect of (A) any Letter of Credit, (B) any draft or other
document required or permitted under the relevant Letter of Credit, this
Agreement or any other Loan instrument, or (C) any instrument or document
transferring or assigning the Letter of Credit, any rights or benefits
thereunder or any proceeds thereof (in whole or in part), or purporting to do
so, even if any of them should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, ineffective, incomplete, inaccurate, fraudulent or
forged; (v) the failure of any person to surrender, obtain, forward or otherwise
deal with the Letter of Credit or any other document other than the surrender
and obtaining of any drafts


                                      -37-




<PAGE>



or other documents specifically required by the terms of the Letter of Credit;
(vi) any failure to note the amount of any draft on the reverse of the Letter of
Credit; (vii) any and all errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any notice, request, demand or other communication
permitted or required to be given under this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, whether by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, telecopy or otherwise,
whether or not an error in processing, cipher, translation or otherwise or an
error in interpretation (of technical terms or otherwise); (viii) any loss or
delay in the delivery of any draft, document or proceeds; (ix) the existence,
character, quality, quantity, condition, packing, value, or delivery of any
goods or other property relating to any Letter of Credit, the time, place,
manner or order in which shipment may have been made, the existence, form,
validity, sufficiency or legal effect of any insurance covering or purporting or
required to cover any such goods, or any act or omission of any insurer,
shipper, warehouseman, carrier, correspondent or other person, or (x) without
limiting the foregoing, any consequences arising from causes beyond the control
of the Administrative Agent, any other issuer or any other Bank or any of their
respective Representatives or any act or omission of any of them not done or
omitted in bad faith (each of which provision, if contained in the Letter of
Credit itself, may be waived by the Fronting Bank or other issuer in its sole
and absolute discretion). If the Letter of Credit provides that payment is to be
made by a designated Representative of the Fronting Bank or other issuer, none
of the Fronting Bank, any other issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Bank and
their respective Representatives (other than such designated Representative)
shall be responsible or otherwise liable for the failure of any document
specified in the Letter of Credit to come into the Fronting Bank's hands or for
any delay in connection therewith, and the obligation of the Borrowers to
reimburse the Fronting Bank, any other issuer, the Administrative Agent or any
other Bank for payments made or obligations incurred shall not be affected by
such failure or delay in the receipt by the Fronting Bank or other issuer of any
or all of such documents whether sent to the Fronting Bank or other issuer in
one or multiple mailings. In any event, neither the Fronting Bank, the
Administrative Agent nor any other issuer shall be responsible for any error,
neglect, suspension or insolvency of any of the Representatives of the
Administrative Agent or other issuer designated to confirm or pay with respect
to any Letter of Credit. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that this
Agreement has been entered into and all Letters of Credit have been and shall be
obtained by the Borrowers for commercial purposes. Each Borrower agrees that it
will not raise (as a defense or otherwise), and each Borrower hereby expressly
waives, any immunity or exemption from liability, jurisdiction, forum or service
that may now or hereafter be accorded to any Borrower, its Representatives or
any of their respective assets and properties. The preceding agreements and
waivers are not intended (and shall not be deemed or construed) to in any way
qualify, condition, diminish, restrict, limit or otherwise affect any (and is in
addition to each) other release, waiver, consent, waiver, exculpation,
indemnification, permitted action or other similar term or provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Instrument.

          Section 2.08. Payments and Applications.

          (a) Until such time as either (i) the Borrowers have defaulted in any
payment to any Bank for more than five Business Days, (ii) a Default Declaration
has been issued, or (iii) any Bank is in any continuing default under Article IX
hereof, whichever occurs first, all payments of principal, interest, fees and
other amounts due the Banks or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments shall be made in United States Dollars
in immediately available funds by 12:30 P.M. (New York City time) on the date
payment is due directly to each Bank at its offices at the appropriate address
set forth in the Introduction or as otherwise instructed by each Bank. During
the continuance of any Event of Default prior to maturity, and at any time after
the Maturity Date, the Administrative Agent may direct the Borrowers to make all
payments covered by this subsection directly to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection (c) below.

          (b) The parties intend that payments of the Obligations that may be
directly billed by each Bank under subsection (a) of this Section may be made
through the deposit of sufficient amounts by


                                      -38-




<PAGE>



the Borrowers into specified accounts maintained with each Bank or any
designated affiliate(s) as and when such Obligations become due, and the
debiting of such account by or at the direction of the relevant Bank.
Accordingly, each Borrower hereby authorizes each Bank (or such affiliate) from
time to time to apply or direct the application of all or any portion of the
funds in any such account to the payment of principal and interest on Loans and
to all other Obligations of the Borrowers hereunder at each time such payment
becomes due and payable under subsection (a) above. In debiting such accounts,
the Obligations shall be deemed to have been paid or repaid only to the extent
of the immediately available funds actually available in and debited from that
account and applied to the Obligations, notwithstanding any internal procedure
of the relevant Bank (or such debiting affiliate) to the contrary.

          (c) All payments of principal, fees and amounts not directly payable
under subsections (a) and (b), above (including all payments of interest, fees
and other amounts no longer directly payable under such subsections) due the
Banks pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments shall be made in
United States Dollars in immediately available funds by 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time) on the date payment is due to the Administrative Agent at its offices
at 300 Broad Hollow Road, Melville, New York 11747, or as otherwise instructed
by the Administrative Agent. All advances and payments made pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments shall be recorded by each Bank on its
books and records, and such books and records shall, absent manifest error, be
conclusive as to the existence and amounts thereof.

          (d) Should any payment become due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day, and, in the case of any payment of principal, interest shall be
payable thereon at the rate per annum specified in this Agreement during such
extension.

          (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, so long as no
Event of Default is then continuing, any funds received by any of the Banks from
or on behalf of any Borrower (whether pursuant to any of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument) shall be applied to
the following items in the manner and order reasonably designated by the
Borrowers to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided however, that
absent such designation or during the continuance of any such event, those funds
(including the net proceeds from any Collateral) instead shall be applied to the
following items in the following order and manner to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law:

     (i)  the payment to or reimbursement of the Administrative Agent or any
          other Bank for any expenses actually incurred for which any of them is
          entitled to be paid or reimbursed pursuant to any of the provisions of
          this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments;

     (ii) the payment of interest, fees and commissions then due hereunder,
          ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
          amounts of interest, fees and commissions then due to such parties;

     (iii) the payment of principal of Loans and Letter of Credit Advances then
          due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
          accordance with the amounts of principal of Loans and Letter of Credit
          Advances then due to such parties;

     (iv) the establishment or maintenance of any cash collateral required or
          permitted under any Loan Instrument; and

     (v)  the payment in full of all other Obligations under this Agreement and
          the other Loan Instruments;


                                      -39-




<PAGE>



provided, however, that after the occurrence of an Event of Default, payments
will be applied to the obligations of the Borrowers to the Banks, the Fronting
Bank and the Administrative Agent as each Bank, the Fronting Bank and the
Administrative Agent determines in its sole discretion with respect to the
Obligations owing to it.

          Section 2.09. Taxes. Any and all payments made by the Borrowers under
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument shall be made free and clear of and
without any reduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings, and any and all liabilities with respect
thereto, excluding, however, such taxes as are imposed on a Bank (a) by the
jurisdiction of its organization or its lending office engaged in the Loans (or
any political subdivision thereof) with respect to the income or franchise of
such Bank, or (b) by reason of such Bank's failure to comply with the
requirements of Section 10.13(d) hereof (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings being hereinafter collectively
referred to as the "Taxes"). In addition, the Borrowers shall pay, as and when
due, any and all present or future stamp or documentary taxes or other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies that may arise from any execution,
delivery, performance, existence or registration of this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument or any payment made hereunder or thereunder (collectively,
"Other Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required by Applicable Law to deduct
any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable to the Banks
under this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, (x) the sum payable shall be
increased as may be necessary so that, after making all required deductions, the
Banks receive an amount equal to the sum they would have received if no such
deductions had been made, (y) such Borrower shall make such deductions, and (z)
such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
Authority or other Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. Within 30 days
after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrowers, the
Borrowers will furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt evidencing payment or other documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent evidencing payment. The Borrowers will
furnish to the Administrative Agent, upon the Administrative Agent's request
from time to time, an officer's certificate stating that, to the knowledge of
the signer, all Taxes and Other Taxes that are or have become due have been
paid. The Borrowers shall indemnify and reimburse (on a joint and several basis)
each Bank and the Administrative Agent on demand (payable within 30 days of
written demand) for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Bank(s)
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any and all claims,
liabilities, losses and expenses actually incurred (including, without
limitation, penalties, interest, and reasonable attorneys and other professional
fees, disbursements and expenses) of such Bank(s) or the Administrative Agent
arising therefrom or related directly or indirectly thereto, whether or not such
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted.

          Section 2.10. Lost or Damaged Notes. In the event of the loss, theft
or destruction of a Note, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver an identical
new Note to the affected Bank in substitution therefor upon the receipt by the
Borrowers of (a) notice from the affected Bank confirming such event and (b) if
requested by the Borrowers, an indemnity agreement from the affected Bank in
such form and substance as may be reasonably acceptable to the affected Bank. In
the event of the mutilation of or other damage to a Note, the Borrowers shall
execute and deliver an identical new Note to the affected Bank in substitution
therefor, following which the affected Bank will return the mutilated or damaged
Note to the Borrowers.

          Section 2.11. Maximum Interest Rate. It is the intention of the Banks
and the Borrowers that the interest (as defined under Applicable Law) on the
Loans that may be charged to, collected from or received from the Borrowers
shall not exceed the maximum rate permissible under Applicable Law. Accordingly,
anything in this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Instrument to the
contrary notwithstanding, in the event any interest (as so defined) is charged
to, collected from or received from the Borrowers by the Banks pursuant hereto
or thereto in excess of such maximum lawful


                                      -40-




<PAGE>



rate, then the excess of such payment over that maximum shall be applied to the
reduction of the outstanding principal balance of the Loans and the other
Obligations (without any prepayment premium or penalty) and any portion of such
excess payment remaining after payment and satisfaction in full of the
Obligations shall be returned by the Banks to the Borrowers.

          Section 2.12. Obligations and Communications of the Borrowers.

          (a) All of the obligations, liabilities, representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements of any one or more of the Borrowers under or in
any way connected with this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, including
without limitation the Obligations, shall be joint and several and each Borrower
shall be jointly and severally liable for all such obligations, liabilities and
Obligations. Each Borrower shall be liable for all amounts due to the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and/or any Bank under this Agreement,
regardless of which Borrower actually receives Extensions of Credit or the
amount of such Extensions of Credit received or the manner in which the
Administrative Agent and/or such Bank accounts for such Extensions of Credit on
its books and records. Each Borrower's Obligations with respect to Extensions of
Credit made to it, and each Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the
joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder, with respect to
Extensions of Credit made to the other Borrowers hereunder, shall be separate
and distinct obligations, but all such Obligations shall be primary obligations
of each such Borrower. Any knowledge held by or imputed to any Borrower shall be
deemed to be within the knowledge of all of the Borrowers. Any certificate,
notice, request, statement or other document or communication signed or made on
behalf or in the name of any one or more of the Borrowers shall be deemed to
have been signed or made by all of the Borrowers unless expressly disclaimed in
a particular document or communication.

          (b) Each Borrower agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Bank shall have any responsibility to inquire into the apportionment, allocation
or disposition of any Extensions of Credit as among the Borrowers.

          (c) Without limiting the generality of the joint and several nature of
the Obligations and the other obligations, representations, warranties,
covenants and other agreements of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments, each Borrower hereby makes, constitutes and appoints
Aeroflex and each of its executive officers (Treasurer or Vice President and
above), and each of them with full power of substitution, as such Borrower's
true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power and authority from time to time
in such Borrower's name, place and stead to (i) make requests for, or
conversions or continuations of, Extensions of Credit, the execution and
delivery of certificates and the receipt and allocation of disbursements from
the Banks, (ii) pay or otherwise perform any of the other Obligations, (iii)
mortgage or grant security interests in any of the assets and properties of such
Borrower to secure any of the Obligations, (iv) give notices and other
communications under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, (v) agree to
waivers, supplements, modifications, amendments, restatements and replacements
of and additions to this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, (vi) take or
authorize any other action contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments, and (vii) sign, execute, acknowledge, swear to, verify, deliver,
file, record and publish any one or more of the foregoing. Aeroflex hereby
accepts such appointment. This Power of Attorney is hereby declared to be
revocable only with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
will not be withheld unreasonably, with full power of substitution and coupled
with an interest. This Power of Attorney shall survive the dissolution,
reorganization or bankruptcy of any Borrower and shall extend to and be binding
upon each Borrower's successors and assigns. This Power of Attorney may be
exercised, among other ways, (i) by any one of the above-named
attorneys-in-fact, or by any substitute designated by any of those
attorneys-in-fact, and (ii) by signing for the Borrowers individually on any
document or instrument or by listing two or more of the persons, including the
Borrowers, for whom any document or instrument is being signed


                                      -41-




<PAGE>



and signing once, with a single signature by the attorney-in-fact or substitute
being effective to exercise the Powers of Attorney of all persons so listed. A
facsimile signature shall be effective if so affixed.

          (d) Any certificate, notice, communication, election, representation
and warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking, request, statement or other
document or communication made by any of the above-named attorneys-in-fact shall
be deemed to have been signed or made by all of the Borrowers pursuant to this
Power of Attorney and any certificate, notice, communication, election,
representation and warranty, covenant, agreement, undertaking request, statement
or other document or communication required or permitted to be given to any
Borrower or Borrowers hereunder that is given to any of the above-named
attorneys-in-fact shall be deemed to have been given to all of the Borrowers
pursuant to this Power of Attorney and shall be binding upon and enforceable
against such Borrowers to the same extent as if the same had been given directly
to such Borrowers, in each case irrespective of whether any reference to this
power or to one or more of the other Borrowers is made therein, unless such
exercise expressly disclaimed in a particular document or communication. In the
event of any conflict between the exercise of this power and the one granted to
the Administrative Agent in Section 7.06 hereof, the one granted to the
Administrative Agent shall prevail.

          (e) Each Borrower assumes all responsibility for being and keeping
itself informed of each other Borrower's and any guarantor's financial condition
and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment
of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such
Borrower or any guarantor assumes and incurs under any Loan Instrument, and
agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any duty to
advise such Borrower, any other Borrower or any guarantor of information known
to the Administrative Agent or any Bank regarding such circumstances or risks.

          (f) Each Borrower hereby waives, with respect to itself and its
obligations hereunder, any right (except as shall be required by applicable
statute and cannot be waived) to require the Administrative Agent or any Bank to
(i) proceed against any other Borrower, any guarantor or any other Person, (ii)
proceed against or exhaust any security held from any other Borrower, any
guarantor or any other Person or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the
Administrative Agent or any Bank's power whatsoever. Each Borrower hereby waives
any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any other Borrower, any
guarantor or any other Person other than payment in full of the Obligations,
including any defense based on or arising out of the disability of any other
Borrower, any guarantor or any other Person, or the enforceability of the
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of any Borrower other than payment in full of the Obligations.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Administrative Agent or any Bank
may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent
or any Bank by one or more judicial or non-judicial sales, provided that any
such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by
applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the Administrative Agent
or any Bank may have against any other Borrower, any guarantor or any other
Person, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability
of any Borrower hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid in
full. With respect to each Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the
joint and several liability of the Borrowers hereunder with respect to
Extensions of Credit made to the other Borrowers hereunder, each Borrower
waives, until the Obligations shall have been paid in full and this Agreement
shall have been terminated, any right to enforce any right of subrogation or any
remedy which the Administrative Agent and/or any Bank now has or may hereafter
have against the Borrowers, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of
the Obligations, and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any
security or collateral given to the Administrative Agent and/or any Bank to
secure payment of the Obligations or any other liability of the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent and/or any Bank. Each Borrower waives all rights and
defenses arising out of any such election of remedies by the Administrative
Agent or any Bank, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial


                                      -42-




<PAGE>



foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed
any of such Borrower's, any other Borrower's or any guarantor's rights of
subrogation and reimbursement against any other Borrower or any guarantor by the
operation of applicable law or otherwise.

          (g) Each Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the joint and
several liability of the Borrowers hereunder with respect to Extensions of
Credit made to the other Borrowers hereunder shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be unconditional irrespective of (i) the validity or
enforceability, avoidance or subordination of the Obligations of the other
Borrowers or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any part
of the Obligations of the other Borrowers, (ii) the absence of any attempt to
collect the Obligations from the other Borrowers, any other guarantor, or any
other security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same,
(iii) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence
by the Administrative Agent and/or any Bank with respect to any provision of any
instrument evidencing the Obligations of the other Borrowers, or any part
thereof, or any other agreement now or hereafter executed by the other Borrowers
and delivered to the Administrative Agent and/or any Bank, (iv) the failure by
the Administrative Agent and/or any Bank to take any steps to perfect and
maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its rights to, any security or
collateral for the Obligations of the other Borrowers, (v) the Administrative
Agent's and/or any Bank's election, in any proceeding instituted under the
Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy
Code, (vi) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by the other Borrowers,
as debtors-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (vii) the
disallowance of all or any portion of the Administrative Agent's and/or any
Bank's claim(s) for the repayment of the Obligations of the other Borrowers
under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (viii) any other circumstances
which might constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor
or of the other Borrowers.

          (h) Upon any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may proceed
directly and at once, without notice, against any or all of Borrower to collect
and recover the full amount, or any portion of the Obligations, without first
proceeding against the other Borrowers or any other Person, or against any
security or Collateral for the Obligations. Each Borrower consents and agrees
that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to marshal any
assets in favor of the Borrowers or against or in payment of any or all of the
Obligations.

          (i) Reference to a single specific Borrower or group of Borrowers,
whether by name, officers title, letterhead or otherwise, shall not constitute
an express disclaimer of any of the foregoing.

          Section 2.13. Subrogation and Contribution. Each Borrower covenants
and agrees that until the Obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and
the other Loan Instruments have been fully paid, performed and satisfied, any
and all Subordinated Rights shall be subordinate and inferior in priority and
dignity to the Obligations and shall not be entitled to any payment or
satisfaction (in whole or in part) until all of the Obligations have been fully
paid and satisfied. Until such time (if ever) as the Obligations have been fully
paid and satisfied: (x) the Borrowers shall not seek any payment or exercise or
enforce any right, power, privilege, remedy or interest that any Borrower may
have with respect to any Subordinated Right except with the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as
and if required) and for the benefit of all of the Banks; and (y) any payment,
asset or property delivered to or for the benefit of any Borrower in respect of
any Subordinated Right shall be accepted in trust for the benefit of all of the
Banks and shall be promptly paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent (for
the benefit of all of the Banks) to be credited and applied to the payment and
satisfaction of the Obligations, whether contingent, matured or unmatured, or to
be held by the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) as
additional Collateral, as the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the
Requisite Banks, as and if required) may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion.

          Section 2.14. Waiver of Impairment of Contribution and Other Rights.
Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the amounts (if any) that
potentially could be realized by such Borrower, as well as the enforceability,
practicality or value of any right, power, privilege, remedy or interest of such
Borrower, under or in respect of any Subordinated Right may be substantially
reduced or limited or completely eliminated by any one or more of the following
(either individually or in the aggregate): (i) the delay inherent in the
subordination of those rights under this Agreement, (ii) payments by any other
Borrower or others to the Administrative Agent, any Bank or any other person,
(iii) any foreclosure, sale, lease or other disposition or realization
respecting any Collateral, (iv) any action or inaction by the Administrative
Agent, any Bank or any other person authorized or waived by or on behalf of such
Borrower, whether under this Agreement or otherwise, or contemplated, permitted
or provided for under this Agreement, any other Loan Instrument or Applicable
Law, (v) the exercise or enforcement by the Administrative Agent or any other
Bank of any one or more of its rights, powers privileges, remedies and interests
of the Administrative Agent or any other Bank under any Loan Instrument or
Applicable Law, or (vi) any adverse change (however material) in the assets,
business, operations, properties, or condition (financial or otherwise) of any
other Borrower or any other person arising out of or related directly or
indirectly to any of the foregoing; (b) neither the Administrative Agent nor any
Bank is acting as an agent, trustee or other representative (regarding
collateral or otherwise) with respect to any Subordinated Right; (c) the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank may exercise or enforce any of its
rights, powers, privileges, remedies or interests under the Loan Instruments and
Applicable Law without any consideration of or regard to any Subordinated Right
or any direct or indirect adverse effect thereupon (however material); (d) such
Borrower shall not be entitled to any payment or other asset or property (or any
part thereof) delivered to or otherwise realized by the Administrative Agent or
another Bank on account of any of the Obligations or to any accounting thereof;
(e) none of the foregoing (whether individually or in the aggregate) shall (i)
release, limit or otherwise affect the liability of such Borrower to the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank under this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, or (ii) give rise to any action, claim, counterclaim, right of
setoff or recoupment, defense, or other remedy on the part of such Borrower
irrespective of frequency, direct or indirect effect, materiality, or direct or
indirect consequences; and (f) such Borrower shall not raise any, and hereby
expressly waives and releases each and every, such action, claim, counterclaim,
right of setoff, or recoupment, defense, or other remedy.

          Section 2.15. Guaranty of Payment and Expenses. Each Borrower
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to the Administrative Agent, the
Fronting Bank and each Bank the full and punctual payment and satisfaction of
the Obligations of each and every other Borrower as and when due, whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, and agrees to pay and satisfy in
full any and all reasonable expenses that are paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any other Bank in the collection of
all or any portion of the Obligations of any Borrower or the exercise or
enforcement of any one or more of the other rights, powers, privileges, remedies
and interests of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and the Banks under
this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, irrespective of the manner or
success of any such collection, exercise or enforcement, and whether or not such
expenses constitute part of the Obligations (collectively, the "Guaranty").

          Section 2.16. Continuing Guaranty, Payment in Accordance with Terms,
Etc. Each Borrower covenants and agrees that: (a) the Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty of payment and satisfaction, and not collectability only, whether the
Obligations are now or hereafter existing, acquired or created, and irrespective
of the fact that from time to time under the terms and provisions of the Loan
Instruments monies may be advanced, repaid and readvanced and the outstanding
balance of the Loans may be zero; (b) the Guaranty may not be revoked or
terminated until such time as all of the Obligations shall have been fully paid
and satisfied; (c) the Obligations shall not be deemed to have been otherwise
fully paid and satisfied so long as any Loan Instrument shall have any

will be paid and satisfied in full in accordance with the

Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction, including (without
limitation) any Applicable Law that might in any manner affect any of those
terms and provisions or any of the rights, powers, privileges; remedies and
interests of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any other Bank with
respect thereto, or that might cause or permit to be invoked any alteration in
the time. amount or manner of payment of any of the Obligations by any Borrower
or any other person (other than any Bank).

Agreement; (b) notice of any action taken or omitted in reliance hereon; (c)

effect, whether individually or in the aggregate, upon the assets, business,
operations, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower or
any other person, or upon any part of any Collateral securing the obligations of

constraint under any Applicable Law, whether with respect to the Obligations; or

Agreement or any other Loan Instrument. No act or omission of any kind in
connection with any of the foregoing shall in any way impair or otherwise affect
the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any term or
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument or any of the
Borrowers' Obligations under the Guaranty.

          Section 2.18. Agreement Not Affected. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing Sections or any other term or provision of this Agreement, each
Borrower (in its capacity as a guarantor under the Guaranty) covenants, agrees
and consents that, at any time, and from time to time: (a) the Loans may be

upon, dealt with or disposed of, in whole or in part, whether to the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any other Bank, its designee or

may be held without due recordation or other perfection (whether intentionally
or otherwise), may be recorded or otherwise perfected, or may be assigned,

or in part; (f) any one or more payments, distributions and proceeds received

Borrower or any such other Person owed to the Administrative Agent, the Fronting
Bank or any other Bank or any of its Affiliates; (g) the liability of such

<PAGE>



any other Loan Instrument or Applicable Law against any of the deposits, assets,
properties and Indebtedness subject thereto, without any demand on or notice to
any Borrower, without regard to the frequency of exercise thereof, and whether
or not the relevant obligations shall then be matured; (i) any representation,
warranty, covenant or other term or provision of any Loan Instrument, in whole
or in part, may be the subject of one or more waivers of applicability or
consents to nonperformance, noncompliance or nonobservance, whether or not
constituting defaults, or may be otherwise not exercised or enforced (whether
intentionally or otherwise); (j) any Loan Instrument, or any term or provision
thereof, in whole or in part, may be renewed, extended, supplemented, modified,
amended, restated or otherwise changed in any respect by the respective parties
thereto in the manner provided therein; (k) any one or more of this Agreement

privileges, remedies and interests of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting
Bank or any other Bank herein or therein, may be sold, conveyed, assigned or
otherwise transferred in whole or part (including participations or other
undivided interests) to any other Person; or (1) any other right, power,
privilege, remedy or interest of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or
any other Bank under this Agreement, any other Loan Instrument or Applicable Law
may be exercised or enforced by the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or
any other Bank, or its designee, which exercise or enforcement may be delayed,
discontinued or otherwise not pursued or exhausted for any or no reason
whatsoever, or any such right, power, privilege, remedy or interest may be
waived, omitted or otherwise not exercised or enforced (whether intentionally or
otherwise); all in such manner and order, upon such terms and provisions and
subject to such conditions as the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any
other Bank may deem necessary or desirable in its sole and absolute discretion,
in each case subject to any limitations imposed by the terms of this Agreement,
including Section 7.01 hereof, all without notice to or further assent from such
Borrower, and all without affecting this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument
or any of such Borrower's Obligations under the Guaranty, which obligations
shall continue in full force and effect until such time as all of the
Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied.

          Section 2.19. Bankruptcy, Reinstatement. In the event the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or any other Bank is not permitted or is
otherwise unable (because of the pendency of any bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other proceeding) to accelerate the Obligations, but otherwise
would have been permitted to do so at such time pursuant to any Loan Instrument,
the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank or such Bank may demand payment in
full under the Guaranty and may exercise and enforce the other rights, powers,
privileges, remedies and interests of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting
Bank or any other Bank under this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument to
which the guarantying Borrower is a party as if the Obligations had been duly
accelerated, and each guarantying Borrower will not raise, and each hereby
expressly waives and releases, any claim or defense with respect to such deemed
acceleration. In the event any payment of or any application of any amount,
asset or property to any of the Obligations, or any part thereof, at any time is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent,
the Fronting Bank or any other Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any Borrower or any other Person, whether by order of any
court, by any settlement approved by any court, or otherwise, then the terms and
provisions of this Guaranty shall continue to apply, or shall be reinstated if
not then in effect, as the case may be, with respect to the Obligations so
rescinded, restored or returned, all as though such payment or application had
never been made.

          Section 2.20. Transitional Matters. On the Effective Date this
Agreement shall have amended, restated and completely replaced the Existing Loan
Agreement and the Notes shall have amended, restated and completely replaced the
Existing Notes (as more fully described in Sections 2.01, 2.02 and 2.03 hereof);
but no such action shall be deemed a repayment, satisfaction, cancellation or
novation of the Existing Obligations, which shall continue and constitute
Obligations of the Borrowers under and subject to the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments. The Loan Instruments are
intended, and shall be deemed and construed, to be a continuation (without


                                      -46




<PAGE>



interruption or recommencement) of the various terms and provisions of the
Existing Loan Instruments and the obligations arising or accruing thereunder
prior to the Effective Date, subject to any modifications made by the Loan
Instruments. For example (and without limitation); (a) all principal, interest,
fees, reimbursements and other amounts heretofore owed or accruing under the
Existing Loan Instruments will continue to be owed, to accrue and to be payable
under the Loan Instruments, subject to any modifications made by the Loan
Instruments; (b) the Borrowers shall deliver all financial statements and
reports required under the Existing Loan Instruments respecting periods ending
on or before the Effective Date, and not yet delivered, which shall be deemed to
be statements and reports delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) any term or
provision of any Loan Instrument relating to the 2002 calendar year or the
fiscal years ending June 30, 2002 or June 30, 2003, shall include all of the
year or fiscal year (even though portions may predate the Effective Date); and
(d) any misrepresentation or default by the Borrowers under the Existing Loan
Instruments continuing as of the Effective Date shall continue and constitute a
corresponding continuing misrepresentation or default by the Borrowers under the
Loan Instruments, with any time periods for notice, grace or the like under the
Loan Instruments having commenced to run at their inception under the Existing
Loan Instruments, subject to any modifications made by the Loan Instruments.

                                  ARTICLE III
                         Representations and Warranties

          To induce the Banks to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments to which each is a party and to make and continue the Loans to the
Borrowers, the Borrowers jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Banks that:

          Section 3.01. Organization, Powers, Etc. Each Borrower: (a) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation; (b) has the power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own or hold under lease the assets and
properties it purports to own or hold under lease, (c) is duly qualified,
licensed or registered to transact its business and in good standing in every
jurisdiction in which failure to be so qualified, licensed or registered has had

3.01(c) hereto contains a complete and accurate list of all jurisdictions in
which such Borrower is so qualified, licensed or registered, (d) has the power
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the other Loan
Instruments to which it is or will be a party and to perform all of its
obligations hereunder and thereunder; and (e) has its executive office and
principal place of business at the address(es) set forth in the Introduction.

          Section 3.02. Authorization, Conflicts and Validity. The execution and
delivery by each Borrower of this Agreement and each of the other Loan
Instruments to which it is or will be a party and the performance by each
Borrower of all of its obligations hereunder and thereunder: (a) have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action; (b) will not violate or be in
conflict with any term or provision of (i) any Applicable Law (including,
without limitation, any applicable usury or similar law, but excluding those

Effect), (ii) any judgment, order, Writ, injunction, decree or consent of any
court or other judicial Authority, or (iii) any organizational document; (c)
will not violate, be in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a
default (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of time or both)
under any term or provision of any Material Document, other than any such
violation, conflict, breach or default that has not had or would not be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (d) except as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, will
not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien of any nature upon any of
its assets and properties. This Agreement and each Note are, and the other Loan
Instruments to which any Borrower is or will be a part (when executed and
delivered) will be legal, valid and binding obligations of each signing
Borrower, enforceable in


                                      -47-

accordance with their respective terms and provisions, except as enforceability
may be limited by (1) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other laws affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally and (2) rules
of equity affecting the enforcement of obligations generally (whether at law or
in equity).

          Section 3.03. Consents, Etc. No consent, approval or authorization of,
or registration, declaration or filing with, any governmental Authority or other
person (including, without limitation, the shareholders of any Borrower) is
required as a condition precedent, concurrent or subsequent to or in connection
with the due and valid execution, delivery and performance by any Borrower of
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument to which any Borrower is or will be
a party or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of
their respective representations, warranties, covenants and other terms and
provisions, except (i) as listed on Schedule 3.03 hereto, (ii) the filing of the
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements determined by the Administrative
Agent to be required in connection herewith, and (iii) the compliance under any
applicable assignment of claims statute with respect to any Contract made
directly with any governmental Authority. Each franchise, license, certificate,
authorization, approval or consent from any governmental Authority material to
the present conduct of the business or operations of each Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or required for the acquisition, ownership, improvement, operation
or maintenance by any Borrower of any material portion of the assets and
properties it now owns, operates or maintains, has been obtained and is validly
granted, is in full force and effect and constitutes valid and sufficient
authorization therefore, other than where the failure to so obtain or maintain
any such franchise, license, certificate, authorization, approval or consent
from any governmental Authority has not had or would not be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.04. Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.04 hereto,
there are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings (whether or not
purportedly on behalf of any one or more of the Borrowers) pending or, to the
best knowledge of the Borrowers, threatened or contemplated at law, in equity,
in arbitration or by or before any other Authority involving or affecting: (a)
any Borrower that, if adversely determined, would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect; (b) any alleged criminal act or activity (other than a
misdemeanor) on the part of any Borrower or any of its representatives; (c) the
Obligations; or (d) any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and/or the other Loan Instruments; nor to the best knowledge of the Borrowers,
is there any basis for the institution of any such action, suit, investigation
or proceeding. None of the Borrowers is in default with respect to any judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or consent of any court or other judicial
Authority, which default has had or would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.05. Financial Statements.

          (a) The Borrowers heretofore have provided to the Banks the
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrowers as at June 30, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flow for the
fiscal year ended on that date, audited and reported upon by KPMG LLP,
independent certified public accountants. Those financial statements and reports
and the related notes and schedules, as well as those related to later periods
(whenever delivered), (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein, and (ii) are complete, accurate and a fair presentation of the
financial condition of the Borrowers as of the date thereof and the results of
their operations for the period covered thereby (subject in the case of interim
statements to normal year-end audit adjustments).

          (b) Since June 30, 2002, other than the December Restructuring Charge,
no event or events have occurred that individually or in the aggregate has had
or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.06. Absence of Defaults and Certain Agreements.

          Except as set forth in Schedule 3.06 hereto, no act or event has
occurred and is continuing that violates, is in conflict with, results in a
breach of or constitutes a default (with or without the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both) under any term or provision of (a) this Agreement or
any other Loan Instrument, or (b) any Corporate Document. None of the Borrowers
is a party to any instrument, indenture, agreement, document, arrangement or
other obligation, or subject to any charter or other restriction, that has had
or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 3.07. Compliance with Applicable Laws. Except as otherwise set
forth in Schedule 3.07 hereto, each Borrower is in compliance with and conforms
to all Applicable Laws, other than to the extent that the noncompliance
therewith or violation thereof has not had and could not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

          Section 3.08. Payment of Debts and Taxes.

          (a) Each Borrower: (i) has filed all required tax returns with the
appropriate taxing authorities respecting its operations, assets and properties;
and (ii) has paid or caused to be paid all taxes shown on those returns to the
extent due; except in either case to the extent that (A) extensions of time to
make such filing have been duly granted by the appropriate taxing authorities
and those extensions have not expired, or (B) payment is not yet required
pursuant to Section 5.06 hereof.

          (b) Each Borrower is current in its payment of debts and performance
of obligations (other than taxes) except to the extent payment or performance is
not yet required pursuant to Section 5.06 hereof

          Section 3.09. Indebtedness, Credit Support, ERISA Plans, Etc.

          (a) Schedule 3.09(a) hereto (as and if updated pursuant to Section
5.02 hereof) contains a complete and accurate list of all (i) direct and
indirect Indebtedness of each Borrower (whether individual, joint, several or
otherwise), (ii) all Credit Support of each Borrower with respect to any such
Indebtedness and (iii) other Credit Support of each Borrower, in each case
including commitments, lines of credit and other credit availabilities,
identifying with respect to each the respective parties (and whether the
Borrower is a borrower or guarantor), amounts and maturities, excluding however,
the Loans, all intercompany Indebtedness among the Borrowers and negotiable
instruments endorsed for collection or deposit in the ordinary course of
business and Credit Support pursuant to the Guaranty.

          (b) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.09(c): (i) each "employee
pension benefit plans" (as defined in ERISA) established, funded or maintained
by any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate or to which any Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate is required to contribute (as each may be supplemented, modified,
amended, restated or replaced from time to time pursuant to ERISA or the Code,
as applicable, a "Plan", and collectively, the "Plans") is in full force and
effect and has been (or is expected to be) determined to be duly qualified under
ERISA and the Code, as applicable; (ii) no ERISA Event is currently continuing,
and none has occurred within the past five years, in any material respect; (iii)
each material report, statement or other document has been timely prepared and
delivered in accordance with, and conforms in form and substance to the
requirements of, ERISA and the Code; (iv) each Plan complies with ERISA, the
Code and all other Applicable Laws in all other material respects, (v) the
present value of all accrued benefits under each Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA does not, and did not as of the last annual valuation date, exceed the
value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits


                                      -49-




<PAGE>



(which benefit value shall be determined either on an ongoing basis, using the
Plans reasonable actuarial assumptions, or on a termination basis, using the
assumptions employed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in connection
with plan terminations, as applicable); (vi) there are no actions, suits,
investigations or proceedings (whether or not purportedly on behalf of any
fiduciary, sponsor, participant or beneficiary) pending, or to the best
knowledge of the Borrowers, threatened or contemplated at law, in equity, in
arbitration or by or before any Authority involving or affecting any Plan or any
assets and properties of a Plan that, if adversely determined, would be
reasonably likely to have an ERISA Effect, (vii) to the best knowledge of the
Borrowers, there are no facts or circumstances that might give rise to any
material liability of or material claim against any Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Collateral under Title IV of ERISA; and (viii) none of the
Plans is, and no Borrower or ERISA Affiliate in the past established, funded,
maintained, contributed or was required to contribute to, any "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in ERISA); provided, however, that the provisions of this
sentence shall be to the best knowledge of the Borrowers with respect to any
multiemployer plan administered by a person other than any Borrower or any ERISA
Affiliate. The present value of all accrued post-retirement benefits under each
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA) to which one or more of
the Borrowers and their ERISA Affiliates is required to contribute does not in
the aggregate exceed the assets of such plan allocable to such benefits by more
than $50,000 (determined using the actuarial and other assumptions required
under FAS 106).

          (d) After giving effect to the direct and indirect Indebtedness and
other liabilities and obligations of each Borrower and its Subsidiaries arising
under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, whether absolute or
contingent, Aeroflex on a consolidated basis (i) is solvent (i.e., the aggregate
fair value of its assets exceeds the sum of its liabilities); (ii) has adequate
working capital; and (iii) is able to pay its debts as they mature. No Borrower
is currently considering or planning, and has ever considered or planned, to
take any of the actions specified in Section 8.01(h) hereof, and to the
knowledge of each Borrower no other person is currently considering or planning,
or has ever considered or planned, to take any of the actions specified in
Section 8.01(i) hereof.

          Section 3.10. Assets and Collateral.

          (a) The Borrowers are the holders and severally are the legal and
beneficial owners of, and have good title to: (i) the Collateral; and (ii) all
of the other assets and properties of the Borrowers (A) that are owned by such
Borrowers and are reflected on the most recent report or financial statement
furnished to the Banks or (B) subsequently acquired, excluding, however, such
assets and properties as may have been sold or otherwise disposed of (1) in the
ordinary course of business prior to the date of this Agreement or (2) as
permitted by this Agreement after the date hereof. Each Borrower has full
corporate power and authority and the unconditional right to grant to the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) the security
interests respecting the Collateral contemplated in this Agreement and the other
Loan Instruments. The Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks)
has received legal, valid, binding and enforceable security interests in and to
the Collateral pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments which
security interests shall be perfected upon the delivery of the certificated
Pledged Securities and the filing of any requisite Uniform Commercial Code
financing statements. No property of any Borrower is subject to any Lien or any
adverse claim (other than any claim of any party to a Contract made thereunder)
of any kind whatsoever, except (x) those in favor of the Administrative Agent
(for the benefit of all of the Banks) under the Loan Instruments, (y) those
permitted by Section 6.04 hereof (if any), and (z) those described in Schedule
3.10(a) annexed hereto.

          (b) To the best knowledge of each Borrower, there are no claims (other
than any claim of any party to a Contract made thereunder) of third parties that
would prevent any assignee or purchaser of all or any portion of the Collateral
from receiving any payments, distributions and proceeds


                                      -50-




<PAGE>



with respect thereto, if any, without any, defense, counterclaim, setoff, right
of recoupment, abatement or other claim or determination whatsoever.

          (c) All of the Collateral and the other material assets and properties
of each Borrower (if any) have been and currently are operated, maintained and
insured as respectively required by Sections 5.05, 5.07(a) and 5.07(b) hereof.
Each Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries currently is, and since the Effective
Date has been, insured as required by Section 5.07(b) hereof, and for at least
the five-year period ending with the Effective Date or, with respect to any
Subsidiary or Collateral owned by any Borrower for less than five years, since
the date of ownership of such Subsidiary or Collateral, was insured in a
comparable manner. To the best knowledge of each Borrower, no fact, circumstance
or other event currently exists or has occurred that (i) has violated or could
violate any term or provision of any insurance policy in any material respect,
(ii) has been or could be reasonably likely to permit any insurer to cancel or
refuse to renew (upon similar terms) any such insurance policy, or (iii) has
been or could be reasonable likely to prevent any Borrower from obtaining a
similar insurance police on similar terms.

          (d) The Borrowers have full possession and control of the Collateral
and their other material assets and properties (if any), and all of the
Collateral and their other material assets and properties (if any) are located
(or in the case of accounts and general intangibles are deemed to be located) at
the addresses of the Borrowers set forth in the Introduction.

          (e) Each Account Receivable of each Borrower arose in the ordinary
course of business in a bona fide arm's length transaction, has been reflected
on its books and records in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, and is
represented by a written invoice or other written document that: (i) was duly
executed and delivered and to the best knowledge of the Borrowers contains no
forgeries or unauthorized signatures; (ii) is legal, valid, binding and
enforceable against the customer in accordance with its terms and provisions,
except as enforceability may be limited by (A) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the rights or remedies of
creditors generally and (B) rules of equity affecting the enforcement of
obligations generally (whether at law or in equity); (iii) does not violate or
conflict with any provision of Applicable Law (except where any such violation
or conflict does not have and is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect); (iv) has not been amended or modified in any material respect;
(v) except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(e) hereto, fully reflects all
agreements and understandings with the customer with respect thereto; (vi) is
assignable to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) in
accordance with the terms and provisions hereof and thereof subject to the
receipt of requisite consents for government contracts, and (viii) is maintained
at the office(s) of the relevant Borrower (or at such other office as may have
been specified in a notice to the Administrative Agent) in a file and location
that would be readily identifiable by anyone examining the Accounts Receivable
of the Borrowers. The reserves for uncollectible accounts established by the
Borrowers are adequate in the judgment of the Borrowers to fully cover current
and future uncollectible Accounts Receivable.

          (f) Schedule 3.10(f) hereto contains a complete and accurate list of
(i) all Pledged Securities currently owned of record and/or beneficially by the
Borrowers (whether individually, jointly or otherwise), identifying with respect
to each the owner(s), issuer, type, amount(s) and certificate or other
identifying number(s), or account number(s) and name(s) and address(s) of the
relevant office(s) if held by a clearing corporation, custodian or other
financial intermediary and (ii) all of the Capital Stock issued by each Borrower
(other than Aeroflex) is listed on that schedule. There are no other outstanding
securities issued by any Borrower (other than Aeroflex) or any outstanding
warrants, options or other rights to acquire any securities issued by any
Borrower (other than Aeroflex), whether from the issuer or anyone else. Each
Pledged Security is owned beneficially and of record by the Borrower indicated
on that schedule, is assignable, and has been duly assigned and transferred as
collateral to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks).
Each of the Pledged Securities was duly authorized and


                                      -51-




<PAGE>



validly issued, is fully paid and non-assessable and was acquired from the
issuer in a transaction in compliance with and exempt from registration under
the Securities Act. None of the Pledged Securities: (i) is subject to any
warrant, option, put, call or other right to acquire, redeem, sell, transfer or
encumber it (other than such call and redemption rights as may be intrinsic to
such securities where issued by a person not affiliated with the Borrowers);
(ii) is governed by or otherwise subject to any shareholders agreement, voting
trust or similar agreement or arrangement (other than such call and redemption
rights as may be intrinsic to such securities where issued by a person not
affiliated with the Borrowers); and (iii) is limited or otherwise restricted in
any way respecting assignability, transferability or any voting, dividend,
distribution or other ownership right (whether or not reflected on the face of
the certificate, in any Corporate Document, in any instruction or other
communication to or agreement or arrangement with any transfer agent, clearing
corporation, custodial bank or other financial intermediary, or otherwise). Each
of the Pledged Securities is not and will not be subject to any preemptive or
similar right or restriction. The Borrowers have delivered stock certificates to
the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) representing all
of the Pledged Securities, together with stock powers duly endorsed in blank
representing those certificates.

          (g) Each Material Contract Schedule (to the extent required to be
delivered under this Agreement and so delivered), (i) contains a complete and
accurate list of each Material Contract as of the date of such Schedule and (ii)
with respect to each such Contract accurately states the purchaser, the date of
the Contract and the Contract amount. Each Contract, each other note, stock
certificate or other instrument included in the Collateral, and each other
material Account Receivable, agreement, document or intangible included in the
Collateral: (i) was duly executed and delivered in a written instrument or
document and to the best knowledge of the Borrowers contains no forgeries or
unauthorized signatures; (ii) is legal, valid, binding and enforceable against
the signer in accordance with its terms and provisions, except as enforceability
may be limited by (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other laws affecting the rights or remedies of creditors generally and (B) rules
of equity affecting the enforcement of obligations generally (whether at law or
in equity); (iii) does not violate or conflict with any provision of Applicable
Law in any material respect; (iv) fully reflects all amendments and material
agreements and understandings with the signer with respect thereto; (v) is
assignable, and has been duly assigned to the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of all of the Banks) pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof, in accordance with
the terms and provisions hereof and thereof subject to receipt of requisite
consents for government contracts; and (vi) is maintained at the relevant office
of the relevant Borrower (or at such other office as may have been specified in
a notice to the Banks) in a file and location that would be readily identifiable
by anyone examining the books and records of the Borrowers, except (A) that
certain items may be physically located at the other locations listed in such
Material Contract Schedule, which schedule contains a complete and accurate
description of each other location and the items located there, and (B) for
items physically held by the Administrative Agent or its designee (for the
benefit of all of the Banks).

          (h) The machinery, equipment and other fixed assets owned or leased by
each Borrower that are necessary for the current conduct of its business are in
good working order and condition (ordinary wear and tear and retirement
excepted), all of the machinery, equipment and other fixed assets owned or
leased by each Borrower that are necessary for the current conduct of its
business are used or usable in the current conduct of its business, and each
Borrower has all of the machinery, equipment and other fixed assets necessary
for the current conduct of its business.

          (i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(i) hereto, to the best
knowledge of the Borrowers, the procurement, storage, containment, presence,
manufacture, distribution, removal and disposition of all Inventory and
Environmental Substances by or on behalf of the Borrowers and the use and
operation of all assets and properties owned, leased or used by or on behalf of
the Borrowers (including, without limitation, machinery, equipment, real estate
and improvements), as now or


                                      -52-




<PAGE>



previously existing (whenever created), as conducted by or for any Borrower, or
as contemplated, are in compliance with and conform to all Environmental Laws
and other Applicable Laws in all material respects. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in Schedule 3.10(i) hereto: (i)
all material permits, licenses, authorizations, consents or approvals of
authorities necessary for such activities have been obtained and they are in
full force and effect; (ii) no part of those activities, the Collateral or the
other assets or properties of any Borrower is in violation of any Environmental
Law or other Applicable Law in any material respect; and (iii) no notice has
been served upon any Borrower (other than a notice subsequently withdrawn or
with regard to a violation subsequently cured) from any governmental Authority
or other person claiming, nor does there currently exist, any violation of any
Environmental Law or other Applicable Law in any material respect in connection
with any of those activities, the Collateral or the other assets or properties
of any Borrower.

          (j) Each Borrower has all of the patents, trademarks, tradenames and
other intellectual property rights necessary for the current conduct of its
business and each such patent, trademark, tradename and other intellectual
property right necessary for the current conduct of its business: (i) is
subsisting and has not been determined to be invalid or unenforceable by any
Authority; (ii) to the best knowledge of the Borrowers is valid, binding and
enforceable; (iii) is not and has not been the subject of any claim of
infringement or other material adverse claim; and (iv) has been maintained and
used in accordance with all Applicable Laws.

          (k) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (l) To the best knowledge of the Borrowers, there is no existing,
proposed or contemplated plan, study or effort by any governmental Authority or
other person that in any way has affected or could affect the continued
authorization of the present or contemplated ownership, financing, construction,
use or operation of any part of the Collateral or the other material assets or
properties of any Borrower, or that has resulted or could result in any tax or
other charge being levied or assessed against, or in the creation of any Lien
upon, any part of the Collateral or the other material assets or properties of
any Borrower.

          Section 3.11. Subsidiaries, Other Ventures, Loans and Other
Investments. Schedule 3.11 hereto contains a complete and accurate list of: (a)
all of the direct and indirect Subsidiaries of the Borrowers, including with
respect to each Subsidiary (i) its jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) all

maturities; and (d) all other Investments of the Borrowers other than Permitted
Investments; excluding, however, (i) all loans and advances by any Borrower to
any other Borrower and (ii) all loans or advances of salary to any officer or

aggregate for any such officer or employee does not exceed $250,000.

          Section 3.12. Relationship of the Borrowers. Aeroflex and the other
Borrowers (which are Subsidiaries of Aeroflex) are engaged in the business of,
among other things, developing, manufacturing and selling mechanical and
electronic components and systems and services to government and industry and of
providing the required services and other facilities for those integrated
operations. The Borrowers are seeking to continue the existing facilities from
the Banks in order that funds may continue to be made available from time to
time for working capital and other purposes. Each Borrower expects to derive
financial and other benefit, directly or indirectly, in return for undertaking
its respective obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments,
both individually and as a member of the integrated group.

          Section 3.13. [Intentionally Omitted.]

          Section 3.14. Federal Reserve Regulations, No Restriction on
Borrowing, Etc.

the proceeds of the Loans will be used to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or
to extend credit to any other person for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
any Margin Stock or in any way or for any purpose that otherwise violates or is
inconsistent with any applicable Margin Stock Regulations. No Borrower is

Investment Company Act). None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Loan Instruments (including the making of the Loans and the
permitted use of the proceeds thereof) will violate any provision of the
Investment Company Act.

          (c) No Borrower is a "holding company" or an "affiliate" or a
"Subsidiary company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, or any corresponding provisions
of any Applicable Law in any foreign jurisdiction, and as the same may be
supplemented, modified, amended or restated from time to time, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any corresponding or succeeding
provisions of Applicable Law.

          (d) No Borrower is an "employee benefit plan" governed by (and as
defined in) ERISA, and none of the assets or properties of any Borrower
constitutes or will constitute "plan assets" governed by (and as defined in)
ERISA.

          (e) No Borrower is a "foreign person" under (and as defined in)
'SS' 1455(f)(3) of the Code or any successor provision.

          (f) No Borrower is regulated by or otherwise subject to any Applicable

Liens in or to any of its assets and properties as security for the Indebtedness

of this Section if any Borrower fails to perform any such obligation or to pay
any such Indebtedness or other liability (except for the Obligations), tax,
assessment, or governmental or other charge, levy or claim (i) that is being (A)
delayed, in the case of trade payables (but not other obligations), in
accordance with the normal payment practices of such Borrower, but not beyond
any demand in payment therefore; or (B) contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings diligently pursued, (ii) if the effect of such failure to pay or

other Indebtedness or obligation of any Borrower (other than the one being
contested) or (B) subject any part of the assets and properties of any Borrower
to attachment, levy or forfeiture, (iii) for which such Borrower or such

properties are of a character usually insured by persons engaged in the same or
similar business, against loss or damage resulting from fire, flood, hurricanes
or other risks included in an


                                      -62-




<PAGE>



extended coverage policy, (ii) against public liability and other tort claims

receives any insurance proceeds respecting any loss, damage or destruction of
any insured Collateral, the Administrative Agent at its option may (1) hold and
disburse the proceeds (or a portion thereof) in accordance with Section 7.03(b)
hereof or (2) apply the proceeds (or any remaining balance) to reduce the Loans
as required by Sections 2.05(b) and 7.03(b) hereof. In the event any Borrower
receives any such insurance proceeds (other than disbursements from the
Administrative Agent), such Borrower shall accept and hold those funds in trust
for the benefit of the Banks and shall promptly pay or deliver those proceeds to
the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) for application
as provided above.

          (c) Each Borrower shall maintain or cause to be maintained, at its own
expense, all of its patent, trademark and trade name rights and applications,
including (without limitation) the diligent pursuit of all applications, the
payment of all maintenance, license or other fees and expenses, and the vigorous
prosecution of suits and proceedings to enforce those rights and applications
and to object or oppose the conflicting rights or applications of any other
person, except in each case where such Borrower decides in good faith that a
particular trademark or tradename is of negligible economic value to the
business of such Borrower. Each Borrower (i) shall continue to use each
trademark and tradename of such Borrower in its business and on its goods, (ii)
shall use the appropriate symbol of registration with each use of a trademark or
tradename by such Borrower, (iii) shall not reduce the quality of existing goods
or services bearing a trademark or tradename or use any existing trademark or
tradename with any other goods or services of less than comparable quality, and
(iv) shall not take, or cause, suffer or permit anyone else to take, any action
that may invalidate the registration of any trademark or tradename, except in
each case where such Borrower decides in good faith that a particular trademark
or tradename is of negligible economic value to the business of such Borrower.
Each Borrower shall seek or cause to be sought, at its own expense, (A) patent
applications and patents respecting all unpatented but patentable inventions
made or obtained by such Borrower, (B) trademark applications and registered
trademarks on registrable but unregistered trademarks developed, used or
obtained by such Borrower, and (C) tradename applications and registered trade

that such pursuit would not be useful to its business.

          Section 5.08. Contracts and Other Collateral. Each Borrower shall in
good faith maintain, enforce, preserve and defend any and all of its rights,
powers, privileges, remedies and interests under or with respect to each note,
stock certificate and other instrument, as well as each other material account,
agreement, document and intangible of such Borrower included in the Collateral
to the full extent permitted by Applicable Law, except as otherwise provided in
Section 7.03(a) hereof and except where the failure to do so would not (i)
materially adversely affect the Administrative Agent's or any Bank's rights with
respect to Collateral or (ii) have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 5.09. Defense of Collateral, Etc. Each Borrower shall enforce,
preserve and defend all of its right, title and interest in and to each and
every part of (a) the Collateral, and (b) the other material assets or
properties of such Borrower (if any), and the Borrowers shall defend all of the
right, title and interest of each Bank in and to each and every part of the
Collateral, each against all manner of claims and demands on a timely basis to
the full extent permitted by Applicable Law. In the event any of the Collateral
or any of the other material assets or properties of any Borrower (if any) is
attached or levied or any Lien is imposed on any of the Collateral or such other
assets or properties (other than as permitted by Section 6.04 hereof), then
(without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence) the


                                      -63-

Borrowers shall pay, discharge or bond the underlying obligation and cause the
release of such Collateral or such other assets or properties therefrom within
five days of any attachment or levy or thirty days of the imposition of any
Lien, but in any case before the claimant may defeat the right of the relevant
Borrower to bond, contest or redeem.

Material Domestic Subsidiary to maintain primary operating accounts with one or
more of the Banks.

substance reasonably satisfactory to the Banks with respect to the execution and
delivery of the documents required pursuant to this Section 5.11 and the
granting and perfection of a Lien on all Collateral, if any, owned by the
applicable Subsidiary (such opinion to cover matters typical of opinions in

directly or indirectly: (a) declare or make any dividend, payment or other
distribution of cash, assets or property with respect to any equity securities
issued by any of the Borrowers, whether now or hereafter outstanding, other than
such payments or other distributions as may be made to a Borrower from any of
its Subsidiaries, except that Aeroflex may declare or make any dividend or other
distribution with respect to its common stock payable in common stock, preferred
stock (other than preferred stock that would be considered Indebtedness
hereunder) or any option, warrant or other right to acquire such securities; (b)
redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any securities issued by any of the
Borrowers or any option or other right to acquire any such securities; (c)
covenant or otherwise arrange with any person (other than with the Banks in any
Loan Instrument) to directly or indirectly limit or otherwise restrict any
dividend, advance or other payment on distribution (whether of cash or
otherwise); or (d) offer or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided however
that so long as no Event of Default or Default then exists or would result
therefrom (whether through any Pro Forma Effect or otherwise), Aeroflex may
comply with the provisions of the Rights Agreement and Aeroflex may redeem
fractional shares in connection with any Permitted Acquisition.

          Section 6.09. Use of Loans.

          (a) The Borrowers shall not directly or indirectly use any portion of

the Current Indebtedness that arose under the Existing Loan Instruments and use
of the Revolving Credit Loans for the funding of the working capital needs and
other general corporate purposes of the Borrowers, including Permitted
Acquisitions.

          (b) No part of the proceeds of the Loans shall be used directly or
indirectly to finance any hostile acquisition.

          (c) No part of the proceeds of the Loans or other credit from the
Banks shall be used at any time directly or indirectly to purchase or carry any
Margin Stock or otherwise in any way or for any purpose that violates, or is
inconsistent with, any applicable Margin Stock Regulations.

          Section 6.10. ERISA Plans. Except for the Plans, the Borrowers shall
not, and the Borrowers shall not cause, suffer or permit any of their ERISA
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly establish, maintain, participate in,
contribute to or permit to exist any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined
in ERISA) for any employees of any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate; provided,
however, that any Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate from time to time may
establish any such plan in accordance with Applicable Law (including ERISA and
the Code). The Borrowers shall use their best efforts to obtain or continue the
qualification of each Plan under ERISA and the Code, as applicable, shall
prepare and deliver each material report, statement or other document required
by ERISA and the Code within the periods specified therein and conforming in
form and substance to the provisions thereof, and shall administer each Plan in
all material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other
Applicable Laws, as applicable; and shall use their best efforts to cause their
respective ERISA Affiliates to do each of the foregoing. In any event, no
Borrower shall, and no Borrower shall cause, suffer or permit any of its ERISA
Affiliates to: (i) incur, continue or fail to correct any ERISA Event in any
material respect; (ii) fail to file with the appropriate Authority any required
notice or report respecting any Plan as and when due; (iii) fail to respond in a
timely fashion to any notice or other communication respecting any Plan from any
Authority; (iv) materially increase or materially and adversely modify any
funding obligation or other liability of any one or more of the Borrowers or any
ERISA Affiliate (individually or in the aggregate) under any Plan (whether
through amendment or termination) without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent (which will not be withheld unreasonably); (v) permit the
present value of all accrued benefits under each Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA to exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued
benefits (which benefit value shall be determined either on an ongoing basis,
using the Plan's reasonable actuarial assumptions, or on a termination basis,
using the assumptions employed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in
connection with plan terminations, as applicable); or (vi) permit the present
value of all accrued post-retirement benefits under each "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA) to which one or more of the Borrowers and
their ERISA Affiliates is required to contribute in the aggregate to exceed the
assets of such plan allocable to such benefits by more than $50,000 (determined
by using the actuarial and other assumptions required under FAS 106).

          Section 6.11. Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrowers shall not
directly or indirectly enter into any transaction (including, without
limitation, the lease, purchase, sale or exchange of any asset or property, the
making of any advance or loan or the entering into of any agreement or
arrangement for any payment in respect of any fee, charge or other expense for
the provision of any services or any allocation of administrative salaries,
expenses and other general overhead) with any affiliate (other than a Borrower)
of any Borrower other than in the ordinary course and pursuant to the reasonable
requirements of the business of the transacting party and upon fair and
reasonable terms and provisions no less favorable to the transacting party than
it would have been reasonably likely to have obtained in a comparable arm's
length transaction with a person who is not an affiliate (other than a Borrower)
of any Borrower; provided that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i)
the payment of reasonable and customary regular fees to directors of any of the
Borrowers who are not employees of any of the Borrowers, (ii) loans and advances
to officers of the Borrowers approved by the Boards of Directors of the relevant
Borrowers and permitted by Section 6.06 hereof, (iii) reasonable employment
arrangements and benefit programs for employees of the Borrowers approved by the
Boards of Directors of the relevant Borrowers, (iv) the grant of reasonable
stock options or similar rights to employees and directors of any of the
Borrowers pursuant to plans approved by the Boards of Directors of the relevant
Borrowers, (v) any intercompany Indebtedness permitted by Sections 6.02 and 6.06
hereof, (vi) any, transfer of assets to another Borrower permitted by Section
6.05 or 6.07 hereof, (vii) transactions that


                                      -69-




<PAGE>



would not individually or in the aggregate be reasonably deemed material, (viii)
Permitted Non-Borrower Subsidiary Transfers, (ix) the IFR Debt and the repayment
thereof (as long as no Default or Event of Default exists at the time thereof or
would occur as a result thereof) and (x) any merger, consolidation or
liquidation permitted by Section 6.07 hereof.

          Section 6.12. Modification of the Subordinated Debt Documents, Etc.
The Borrowers shall not directly or indirectly agree to, enter into or cause,
suffer or permit, any supplement to or any waiver (of their rights),
modification, amendment, restatement or replacement of any Subordinated Debt
Document existing on the date hereof or with respect to any Permitted
Subordinated Debt hereafter incurred, or offer, commit or agree to do any of the
foregoing, without the prior written consent of the Majority Banks; provided
that the Majority Banks shall not unreasonably withhold their consent respecting
any new Subordinated Debt Documents for new Permitted Subordinated Debt. The
inclusion of supplements, modifications, amendments, restatements, replacements
and the like in the various definitions of the Subordinated Debt Documents is
not intended and shall not be deemed or construed to be permission for or
acceptance of any of the foregoing by the Majority Banks. In any event, no
Borrower shall cause, suffer or permit: (a) any of the obligations of any
Borrower under any Subordinated Debt Document to be (i) secured by any asset or
property of any Borrower or (ii) less than fully subordinated (in the judgment
of the Majority Banks) to the prior payment and satisfaction of the Obligations;
or (b) any payment to be made or action to be taken under any Subordinated Debt
Document without notice of any proposed action, suit or proceeding to the Banks.

          Section 6.13. Modification of the Material Documents. The Borrowers
shall not directly or indirectly agree to, enter into or cause, suffer or
permit, any supplement to or any waiver (of their rights), modification,
amendment, restatement or replacement of any Material Document existing on the
date hereof or hereafter approved by the Banks (other than any renewal or
extension thereof permitted under Section 6.02(a)(iv) hereof), which would have,
or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The inclusion of
supplements, modifications, amendments, restatements, replacements and the like
in the various definitions of the Material Documents is not intended and shall
not be deemed or construed to be permission for or acceptance of any of the
foregoing by the Majority Banks.

          Section 6.14. [Intentionally Omitted].

          Section 6.15. [Intentionally Omitted].

          Section 6.16. [Intentionally Omitted].

          Section 6.17. Limitation on Negative Pledges. The Borrowers shall not
enter into any agreement which prohibits or limits the ability of any Borrower
to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or
revenues, whether now owned or hereafter acquired.

          Section 6.18. Limitation on Foreign Assets. The net book value of all
tangible assets of the Borrowers located outside of the United States of America
shall not at any time exceed 33% of the net book value of all of the tangible
assets of the Borrowers.

<PAGE>



          (a) Each Borrower hereby pledges, assigns, conveys, mortgages,
transfers and delivers to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank and all of the Banks), and grants to the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Fronting
Bank and all of the Banks) a continuing security interest in and to, all of the
following assets and properties of such Borrower:

     (i)  any and all Pledged Securities; and

     (ii) any and all Springing Collateral (subject to the first proviso set
          forth below);

in each case whether now existing or hereafter acquired or created, whether
owned beneficially or of record and whether owned individually, jointly, as a
security entitlement or otherwise, together with all products and proceeds
thereof, all collections, payments and other distributions and realizations with
respect thereto, any and all other rights, powers, privileges, remedies and
interests of such Borrower therein, thereto or thereunder, and any and all
renewals, substitutions, modifications and extensions of any and all of the
items in the foregoing subsections (the foregoing items will be referred to
collectively, together with the Plainview Property (and any and all of the real
property described in any Mortgage, any and all fixtures and improvements
thereto, and any and all interests therein), as the "Collateral"), as security
for the timely and full payment and satisfaction of the Obligations as and when
due; provided however that (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, unless and until a Trigger Event shall have
occurred, the Springing Collateral shall not be considered to be "Collateral"
hereunder and unless and until such Trigger Event shall have occurred, the
Springing Collateral shall not be subject to any of the terms, limitations or
conditions of this Agreement that specifically relate to "Collateral" and (ii)
the Plainview Property by its terms serves as Collateral for the Mortgage Loans,
interest thereon and the other related Obligations as provided in the Plainview
Mortgage; provided, however, items released from time to time from the Lien of
this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments pursuant to Section 7.04 hereof or
in writing by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks,
as and if required) shall no longer be considered to be "Collateral" hereunder.

          (b) Upon the occurrence of each Trigger Event and at all times
thereafter unless and until a Springing Release Event shall occur (i) the
Springing Collateral shall automatically, without any further action on the part
of any other Person, be deemed "Collateral" for all purposes hereunder (and each
Borrower agrees to execute any and all documentation reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent in connection therewith), (ii) the Administrative Agent
shall be authorized to file Uniform Commercial Code financing statements with
respect to such Springing Collateral, (iii) each Borrower irrevocably authorizes
and instructs the Administrative Agent to, and agrees that the Administrative
Agent may, take any and all steps and actions as necessary or appropriate in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent to Perfect its Liens in the Springing
Collateral, (iv) each Borrower shall be deemed to have made all representations
and warranties contained herein on and as of the date thereof (except to the
extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier
date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date) and (v)
each Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such documents and agreements, including reasonably satisfactory
opinions of counsel, and perform or cause to be performed such other acts, as
may be desirable in the reasonable discretion of the Administration Agent to
better ensure the Perfection and enforceability of the Liens in such Springing
Collateral under applicable law, all such matters to be completed to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent by no later than 30 days
after the date of such Trigger Event. Upon the occurrence of each Springing
Release Event and at all times thereafter unless and until a Trigger Event shall
occur (A) the Springing Collateral shall automatically, without any further
action on the part of any other Person, no longer be deemed "Collateral" for any
purpose hereunder (and the Administrative Agent and each Bank agrees to execute
any and all documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers in connection
therewith), (B) the Borrowers shall be authorized to file Uniform


                                      -71-




<PAGE>



Commercial Code partial release statements with respect to the release of such
Springing Collateral, (C) each Bank and the Administrative Agent irrevocably
authorizes and instructs the Borrowers to, and agrees that the Borrowers may,
take any and all steps and actions as necessary or appropriate in the discretion
of the Borrowers to release the Lien in the Springing Collateral, and (D) the
Administrative Agent and each Bank shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, such documents and agreements and perform or cause
to be performed such other acts, as may be desirable in the reasonable
discretion of the Borrowers to better ensure the release of the Administrative
Agent's Lien on such Springing Collateral under applicable law, all such matters
to be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the Borrowers by no later than
30 days after the date of any such request by the Borrowers. IT IS EXPRESSLY
UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY
HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO OBTAIN A PERFECTED LIEN IN THE SPRINGING COLLATERAL UPON
THE OCCURRENCE OF A TRIGGER EVENT RELATING TO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, NEITHER THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING BANK NOR ANY BANK SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE
WAIVED ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AS A RESULT OF SUCH EVENT OF DEFAULT BY
TAKING ANY SUCH ACTION AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING BANK AND EACH
BANK EACH EXPRESSLY RESERVES ALL OF ITS RIGHTS AND REMEDIES THAT MAY EXIST AS A
RESULT OF ANY SUCH EVENT OF DEFAULT.

          Section 7.02. Collateral Documentation.

          (a) Each Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent or its
designee (for the benefit of all of the Banks) on or before the Effective Date,
and thereafter concurrently with any asset or property becoming Collateral, such
assignments, pledges, deeds, mortgages, financing statements, attornments,
estoppels, waivers, consents, recognitions, bailments and other instruments,
documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent from time to time may deem
necessary or appropriate to evidence, confirm, effect or perfect any mortgage or
other security interest granted or required to be granted under this Agreement
or any other Loan Instrument, each in such form and substance as may be
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks; and, at the
request of the Administrative Agent, an accompanying opinion of counsel
respecting the Borrowers and such additional Collateral to the same effect as
the opinion required by Section 4.05 of this Agreement, in such form and
substance and from such counsel as may be reasonably acceptable to the Banks

          (b) Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative
Agent in its discretion: (i) to file without the signature of such Borrower any
and all financing statements, modifications and continuations in respect of the
Collateral and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Loan Instruments; (ii) to sign any such statement, modification or continuation
on behalf of such Borrower if the Administrative Agent deems such signature
necessary or desirable under Applicable Law; and (iii) to file a carbon,
photographic or other reproduction of any financing statement or modification if
the Administrative Agent deems such filing necessary or desirable under
Applicable Law; provided that unless such filing is permitted as a result of a
Trigger Event, so long as no Event of Default is then continuing, the
Administrative Agent shall accord each Borrower an opportunity to review any
proposed financing statement or modification (but not continuation) to be filed
against it; and provided further that the failure to send any such copy for
review shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any such signature and
filing by the Administrative Agent. The Borrowers shall promptly reimburse the
Administrative Agent for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of any such document. The Administrative Agent shall send
a copy of any such filing to the Borrowers; provided, however, that the failure
to send that copy shall not affect the validity or enforceability, of any such
filing. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any mistake in or
failure to file any financing statement, modification or continuation.

          (c) The Administrative Agent may request that material items of
Collateral be legended or otherwise marked from time to time to reflect the
Administrative Agent's security interests therein (for the benefit of all of the
Banks), and the Borrowers shall promptly mark each requested item in a prominent
location with such legend as the Administrative Agent may direct, which may be
affixed directly or on a permanently attached plaque of customary size. The
Borrowers shall not, and shall not cause, suffer or permit anyone else to,
alter, cover, deface or remove any such legend without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent, except that such legend may be removed from items
released in writing by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the
Requisite Banks, as and if required) from time to time from the security
interests created under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments as
provided herein or therein.

          (d) [Intentionally Omitted.]

          (e) Subject to the immediately following proviso, the Administrative
Agent, or its designee, at any time and from time to time may conduct an audit
or field examination of or otherwise verify or examine the sales and Accounts
Receivable, Inventory, equipment and books and records of the Borrowers in any
manner the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary or desirable;
provided, however, that (i) absent the continuance of any Default or Event of
Default the Administrative Agent will limit its audits and examinations to one
per calendar year, (ii) if the costs and expenses of such audit or field
examination are predominately incurred (rather than when actually paid or
reimbursed and subject in each case to minor fluctuations in timing) during a
Trigger Period, the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay or reimburse the
Administrative Agent for all such costs and expenses and (iii) during the
continuance of any Default or Event of Default the Administrative Agent shall
not in any way be limited by the number of audits and examinations it may
conduct in any calendar year and the costs of all such audits and examinations
shall be borne by the Borrowers. In connection with an audit or examination
being made pursuant to the authorizations in this Section 7.02(e), if requested
by the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers promptly shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent or its designee any and all sales slips, orders, invoices
and other documents evidencing the Accounts Receivable, and shall make
deliveries of subsequent materials at least as frequently as requested, however,
irrespective of any examination by or pledge or delivery to the Administrative
Agent or any Bank, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Bank shall have any
obligation or liability with respect to any Account Receivable of any Borrower,
including (without limitation) any obligation or liability (A) to perform any
obligation of any Borrower, (B) for the enforceability or collectibility of the
Account Receivable or the existence or sufficiency of any documentation, (C) for
the creditworthiness of any account party, (D) for the sufficiency or
reconciliation of any payment received, or (E) to make any inquiry or demand,
make or file any claim, or take any other action to collect or otherwise enforce

          (f) [Intentionally Omitted].

          (g) Promptly following and during the continuance of any Trigger
Event, upon each specific written request of the Banks hereunder, the indicated
Borrower shall execute and deliver assignments of its claims under any requested
Material Government Contracts in form and substance suitable for submission to
the appropriate federal Authority and acceptable to the Banks, assigning all or
such portion of the payments under such Material Government Contract(s) as the
Banks specified in such request.

          Section 7.03. Rights of the Borrowers to the Collateral, Etc. Subject
to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and until such time as the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if
required) shall give notice to the Borrowers to the contrary during the
continuance of any Event of Default and after (or in combination with) any
Default Declaration, without regard to whether any other action has been taken
by the Administrative Agent or any other Bank under


                                      -73-




<PAGE>



this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, the Borrowers shall have the right
to do the things expressly permitted by any subsection of this Section
notwithstanding the restrictions contained in Section 6.05 hereof (but shall not
have such right after such notice has been given to the extent specified in such
notice):

          (a) The Borrowers shall have the full power and authority in the
ordinary course of business (i) to use in their business any item of Collateral
(other than instruments, securities and other general intangibles in the
possession of the Administrative Agent or its designee for the benefit of all of
the Banks), (ii) to maintain, repair, replace and retire equipment in accordance
with Section 5.07(a) hereof, (iii) to temporarily deliver work-in-progress to
one or more subcontractors for processing, and to relocate finished goods
Inventory to one or more public warehouses from which any Borrower has obtained
recognition and access agreements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Banks, (iv) to modify or amend any Contract or other agreement or document
included in the Collateral, (v) to reduce any payment or otherwise settle any,
dispute under any Contract or other material Account Receivable or other
account, note, stock certificate, instrument, agreement, document or intangible
included in the Collateral if such action will not have a Material Adverse
Effect and the Borrowers determine in good faith that it is in their best
interest to do so, (vi) to diligently service and collect the proceeds of any
Accounts Receivable, which may include such discounts and reductions as may be
usual and customary, (vii) to use in their business the cash proceeds from such
Inventory and Accounts Receivable, and (viii) to deposit, withdraw and use in
their business funds and other cash equivalents constituting Collateral under
this Agreement, provided, however, that such power shall not be exercised to the
extent (A) such exercise could conflict with or prejudice the continued
perfection of any security interest in any item of the Collateral (other than
through such sales, use of cash proceeds or withdrawals or use of funds) or (B)
any Event of Default or Default could result therefrom (whether through any Pro
Forma Effect or otherwise).

          (b) In the event of any damage, destruction or other loss, or
condemnation of any Collateral or other asset or property of any Borrower so
long as it does not constitute a default under Section 8.01(l) of this
Agreement, in each case whether in whole or in part, the affected Borrower shall
have the right to apply the amounts received therefrom (whether payments,
proceeds or otherwise) to the repair, rebuilding or replacement of those assets
if, and only if: (A) the affected Borrower in its discretion has elected to
repair, rebuild or replace those assets of at least equivalent value and
business utility; (B) the affected Borrower has sufficient additional funds with
which to do so (if the amounts received and to be received are not sufficient to
do so); and (C) if the affected Borrower does so, (1) those assets would
constitute (or continue to constitute) Collateral (unless repairing, rebuilding
or replacing any asset or property not constituting Collateral), (2) the
representations and warranties of the Borrowers pertaining to that Collateral or
other asset or property in this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments would
(upon completion) be true and correct, and (3) no Event of Default or Default
could result therefrom (whether through any Pro Forma Effect or otherwise). If
those amounts are to be applied to such repair, rebuilding, replacement and are
received by any Bank, then the receiving Bank shall promptly remit those amounts
to the affected Borrower for such use; provided that if such amounts exceed
$1,000,000, the Administrative Agent (at the request of any Bank in its
discretion) shall hold such proceeds as received and disburse them to the
affected Borrower for such purposes upon delivery to the Banks of satisfactory
evidence of (x) full payment to the requisite third parties, (y) good title and
the absence of competing security interests and other encumbrances and adverse
claims, and (z) the satisfaction of such other conditions as may be required by
the Loan Instruments or reasonably requested by the Banks. In the event any
Borrower receives any such payments or proceeds (other than disbursements from
the Administrative Agent or remittances from any such receiving Bank), such
Borrower shall accept and hold those funds in trust for the benefit of the Banks
and shall promptly pay or deliver those proceeds to the Administrative Agent for
application as provided above.

          (d) [Intentionally Omitted].

          (e) In instances not involving a Permitted Disposition, the Borrowers
shall have the full power and authority to relocate any item of Collateral,
except for Collateral held by the Administrative Agent or its designee (for the
benefit of all of the Banks), so long as (i) the new location is within the
continental United States or Puerto Rico, (ii) the relocation will be made at
the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers, which shall bear all risk of loss
and any and all other liabilities related thereto, (iii) the Borrowers give the
Banks at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice of any proposed
relocation, (iv) prior to relocation the Borrowers execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent such instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent
may deem necessary or desirable, (y) prior to relocation the Borrowers provide
evidence satisfactory to the Banks that all insurance will be applicable in the
new location to the extent required by this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments, and (vi) immediately following the relocation as proposed, the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement (as and if updated by
way of supplements to the schedules, statements, reports, certificates or
notices required hereunder and previously delivered to and accepted by the
Administrative Agent) shall be true and correct in all material respects on and
as of that date with the same effect as though those representations and
warranties had been made on and as of that date, provided, however, that the
Borrowers will not make any relocation to which the Banks give written notice of
their objection.

          (f) The Borrowers shall be entitled to exercise in good faith any and
all voting, waiver or consensual rights and powers relating or pertaining to the
Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms
of this Agreement; provided however, that the Borrowers shall not be permitted
to exercise or refrain from exercising any such right or power to the extent
such exercise or nonexercise could (i) have a material and adverse effect on the
value of the Collateral or any part thereof or (ii) result in any Default or
Event of Default.

          (g) [Intentionally Omitted].

          Section 7.04. Partial Releases. The Administrative Agent from time to
time shall release portions of the Collateral from the Liens granted under this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments qualifying for release under and
subject to the terms and conditions of subsection (a) or (b) of this Section,
shall execute and deliver the documentation reasonably required to effect each
such release (in such form and substance as may be acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks), and shall return the applicable
instruments and other documents to the Borrowers or their designee, in each case
subject to receipt of evidence and documentation in such form and substance as
may be acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks, that those
terms and conditions have been satisfied; provided that no Event of Default or
Default then exists or could result therefrom (whether through any Pro Forma
Effect or otherwise). Any and all actions under this Section shall be without
any recourse to or representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any
other Bank and shall be at the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers.

          (a) In the event of any sale or other disposition of any Collateral
expressly permitted under Section 7.03(a) hereof or any other term or provision
of this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, the Administrative Agent will
release that item, subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment
or prepayment from the Borrowers required by this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument.

          (b) In the event any debtor under any indenture, agreement, note,
instrument or Account Receivable pledged to the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of all of the Banks) pursuant to this Agreement shall have paid all
amounts due thereunder in full and shall have complied with all other terms and
conditions thereof, then, subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent of any
payment or prepayment from the Borrowers required by this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument, those items shall be deemed to have been automatically released
as Collateral from the security interests created by this Agreement, and if
requested the Administrative Agent will return the applicable instruments and
other documents to the Borrowers or their designee.

          Section 7.05. Litigation Respecting Collateral.

          (a) In the event that any action, suit or other proceeding (whether or
not purportedly on behalf of any Borrower) at law, in equity, in arbitration or
before any other Authority involving or affecting the Collateral (a
"Proceeding") is contemplated by any Borrower or is otherwise commenced by or
against any party hereto, the Borrowers shall give the Banks immediate notice
thereof. Within twenty (20) Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Majority Banks) shall notify the
Borrowers that either (i) the Administrative Agent will join in the Proceeding,
(ii) a specified designee of the Administrative Agent or any other Bank will
join in the Proceeding, or (iii) the Borrowers may prosecute the Proceeding
without the participation of any Bank or its designee, which Proceeding in any
event shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of
this Section. In the event the Administrative Agent fails to respond to such
notice of the Proceeding within that period, the Banks shall be deemed to have
elected alternative (iii) above, without, however, waiving any other right,
power, privilege, remedy or interest of the Banks under this Agreement, the
other Loan Instruments and Applicable Law.

          (b) If any Borrower elects to commence a Proceeding, or a Proceeding
has otherwise been commenced by or against any party hereto, the Borrowers shall
cause the same to be prosecuted (i) in such a manner that all the rights of the
Banks are preserved and protected to the fullest extent reasonably possible and
(ii) with counsel to such Borrower that is reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks and represents both such Borrower
and the Banks. Subject to compliance by the Borrowers with the foregoing: (A)
the Administrative Agent (if named as a party by someone other than any
Borrower) shall join in the Proceeding and take any other action reasonably
requested by counsel to such Borrower to facilitate the prosecution thereof, all
at the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers; and (B) the Proceeding may be
prosecuted by such Borrower in such manner as such Borrower and its counsel
reasonably deem appropriate. In any event, if the Administrative Agent or any
other Bank determines at any time during the pendency of a Proceeding (after
consultation with counsel to the Administrative Agent) that the interests of one
or more of the Banks are at variance with the interests of any Borrower, the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Majority Banks) may appoint its
own counsel (at the reasonable expense of the Borrowers) to represent the Banks
in the Proceeding, and the Borrowers and their counsel shall cooperate with the
Banks and their counsel to the fullest extent possible in that Proceeding.

          Section 7.06. Power of Attorney. With respect to the various assets
and properties included or required to be included in the Collateral hereunder,
each Borrower hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agents' executive officers (Vice
President or above), and each of them, with full power of substitution, as the
true and lawful attorney-in-fact of such Borrower, with full power and authority
from time to time in the name, place and stead of such Borrower to: (a) take
possession of and execute or endorse (to any Bank or otherwise) any one or more
contracts, mortgages, deeds, pledges, assignments, instruments and other
documents, and any one or more notes, checks, drafts, bills of exchange, money
orders or other documents received in payment for or on account of those assets
and properties; (b) receive, open and dispose of the mail and


                                      -76-




<PAGE>



other deliveries of such Borrower respecting the Collateral and request postal
authorities and others to change the delivery address(es) for such Borrower to
such address(es) as the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or desirable;
(c) demand, collect and receive any monies due on account of those assets and
properties and give receipts and acquittances in connection therewith; (d)
negotiate and compromise any claim, and commence, prosecute, defend, settle or
withdraw any claims, suits or proceedings, pertaining to or arising out of those
assets and properties; (e) pay any Indebtedness or other liability or perform
any other obligation required to be paid or performed under this Agreement or
any other Loan Instrument by the Borrowers or any other person (other than the
Administrative Agent); (f) prepare and execute on behalf of the Borrowers any
mortgage, financing statement or other evidence of a security interest
contemplated by this Agreement, or any modification, refiling, continuation or
extension thereof; (g) take any other action contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Loan Instrument; and (h) sign, execute, acknowledge, swear to, verify,
deliver, file, record and publish any one or more of the foregoing; provided,
however, that the above-named attorneys-in-fact may exercise the powers set
forth in this Section only following the written notice of the Administrative
Agent or any other Bank pursuant to Section 7.07(a) of this Agreement and during
the continuance of the subject Event of Default, whether or not any reference to
this Power of Attorney is made in that notice, and without regard to whether any
other action has been taken by the Administrative Agent or any other Bank under
this agreement or any other Loan Instrument. This Power of Attorney is hereby
declared to be irrevocable, with full power of substitution and coupled with an
interest. This Power of Attorney shall survive the dissolution, reorganization
or bankruptcy of any Borrower and shall extend to and be binding upon the
successors, assigns, heirs and legal representatives of each Borrower. This
Power of Attorney may be exercised (i) by any one of the above-named
attorneys-in-fact, or by any substitute designated by any of those
attorneys-in-fact, and (ii) by signing for any Borrower individually on any
document or instrument, or by listing two or more of the persons (including the
Borrowers) for whom any document or instrument is being signed and signing once,
with a single signature by the attorney-in-fact or substitute being effective to
exercise the Powers of Attorney of all persons so listed. A facsimile signature
shall be effective if so affixed. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any failure to collect or enforce the payment of any of those assets and
properties.

          Section 7.07. Rights of the Banks to the Collateral, Deficiencies,
Etc.

          (a) If any Event of Default shall have occurred and is then continuing
and a Default Declaration has been issued, the Administrative Agent (with the
consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required) may take (and/or may cause
one or more of its designees to take) any or all of the following actions, after
giving the Borrowers prior written notice, or in the case of clauses (vi) or
(ix) after giving the Borrowers at least ten (10) days' prior written notice
(which notice period each Borrower acknowledges and agrees to be adequate and
reasonable, and which notice may be combined with a Default Declaration) to the
Borrowers, with a single such notice being sufficient to entitle the
Administrative Agent from time to time thereafter to take any one or more of the
actions described below):

     (i)  prohibit any Borrower from taking any action with respect to the
          Collateral otherwise permitted by this Agreement and the other Loan
          Instruments;

     (ii) notify each of the mortgagors, obligors, lessees, issuers, custodians
          and other parties with respect to or interested in any item of the
          Collateral of the interest of the Administrative Agent or Banks
          therein or of any action proposed to be taken with respect thereto,
          and direct one or more of those parties to make all payments,
          distributions and proceeds otherwise payable to any Borrower with
          respect thereto directly to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit
          of all of the Banks) or its order until notified by the Administrative
          Agent that all the Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied;


                                      -77-

     (iii) receive and retain all payments, distributions and proceeds of any
          kind with respect to any and all of the Collateral;

     (iv) direct the Borrowers or any other holder of Collateral to assemble and
          deliver such Collateral to the Administrative Agent or its designee at
          such time(s) and place(s) as the Administrative Agent from time to
          time may specify, all without any risk or expense to the
          Administrative Agent or any other Bank; or enter any premises where
          any item of Collateral may be located (to the extent permitted by
          Applicable Law with respect to classified areas), with or without
          permission or process of law but without breach of the peace, and
          seize and remove such Collateral or remain upon such premises and use
          or dispose of such Collateral as contemplated under this Agreement and
          the other Loan Instruments;

     (v)  request the judicial appointment of a receiver respecting the
          Collateral (excluding funds in the possession of any Bank or its
          designee and such other Collateral as the Administrative Agent (with
          the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required) may specify in
          its request) in any action, suit or proceeding in which claims are
          asserted against the Collateral by the Administrative Agent or its
          designee, irrespective of the solvency of any Borrower or any other
          person or the adequacy of any collateral, and without notice to or the
          approval of any Borrower, which receiver shall have the power to
          manufacture, operate, sell, lease or rent such items of Collateral
          pending the sale of all of the Collateral and to collect the rent,
          issues and profits therefrom, together with such other powers as may
          have been requested by the Administrative Agent (with the consent of
          the Requisite Banks, as and if required), and shall apply the amounts
          received (net of all proper charges and expenses) to the Obligations
          as provided in this Agreement;

     (vi) except to the extent provided otherwise by the New York Real Estate
          Law, with respect to Collateral that is not subject to foreclosure and
          the like, take any action with respect to the offer, sale, lease or
          other disposition, and delivery of the whole of, or from time to time
          any one or more items of, the Collateral, including, without
          limitation: (A) to sell, commit, assign, lease or otherwise dispose of
          the whole of, or from time to time any part of, the Collateral, or
          offer, commit or agree to do so, in any established market or at any
          broker's board, private sale or public auction or sale (with or
          without demand on any Borrower or any advertisement or other notice of
          the time, place or terms of sale) for cash, credit or any other asset
          or property, for immediate or future deliver, and for such
          consideration and upon such terms and subject to such conditions as
          the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks as
          and if required) in its sole and absolute discretion may determine in
          a commercially reasonable manner, and any Bank (with the consent of
          the Majority Banks) may purchase (the consideration for which may
          consist in whole or in part of cancellation of Indebtedness) or any
          other person may purchase the whole or any one or more items of the
          Collateral, and all items purchased shall be free and clear of any and
          all rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests of the
          Borrowers (whether individual, joint, several or otherwise), which
          each Borrower has expressly waived pursuant to Section 7.09 hereof (B)
          to postpone or adjourn any such auction, sale or other disposition, to
          cause the same to be postponed or adjourned from time to time to a
          subsequent time and place, or to abandon or cause the abandonment of
          the same, all without any advertisement or other notice thereof, and
          (C) to carry out any agreement to sell any item or items of the
          Collateral in accordance with the terms and provisions of such
          agreement, notwithstanding that, after the Administrative Agent shall
          have entered into such an agreement, all the Obligations may have been
          paid and satisfied in full;


                                      -78-




<PAGE>



     (vii) exercise any voting, consent, enforcement or other right, power,
          privilege, remedy or interest of any Borrower pertaining to any item
          of Collateral to the same extent as if the Administrative Agent were
          the outright owner thereof (for the benefit of all of the Banks),
          provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be entitled to
          exercise any of the voting rights of any Borrower pertaining to any
          equity interest in another person unless and until the Administrative
          Agent has given specific written notice to the Borrowers, apart from
          the notice first referred to in this subsection of the Administrative
          Agent's election to exercise one or more or all, such voting rights;

     (viii) take possession of and thereafter deal with or use from time to time
          all or any part of the Collateral in all respects as if the
          Administrative Agent were the outright owner thereof (for the benefit
          of all the Banks), which shall include (without limitation) the right
          to manufacture, operate, sell, lease or rent items of Collateral as
          well as to sell parts of the Collateral pending the sale of all of the
          Collateral, and to collect the rent, issues and profits therefrom;

     (ix) transfer or cause the transfer of the ownership of all or any part of
          the Collateral (with the consent of the Majority Banks) to its own
          name, the name of any other Bank or any designee and have such
          transfer recorded in any jurisdiction(s) and publicized in any manner
          deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent; and

     (x)  in addition to, and not by way of limitation of, any of the rights
          specified above, exercise or enforce any and all rights powers
          privileges, remedies and interests afforded to the Administrative
          Agent or any other Bank under this Agreement, the other Loan
          Instruments and any and all provisions of Applicable Law (including,
          without limitation, the Uniform Commercial Code and the New York Real
          Estate Law), whether as a secured party or mortgagee in possession of
          collateral or otherwise.

          (b) The Administrative Agent shall collect the cash proceeds received
from any sale or other disposition or from any other source contemplated by
subsection (a) above and/or the Plainview Mortgage, and, after deducting all
costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and any person
designated by the Administrative Agent to take any of the actions enumerated in
subsection (a) above in connection with such collection and sale or disposition
(including reasonable attorneys' disbursements, expenses and fees), the
Administrative Agent shall apply the same in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement unless the Administrative Agent (with the consent
of the Majority Banks) shall elect to retain the same as additional or
substitute Collateral to the extent such retention is permitted by this
Agreement or any other Loan Instrument. In the event any funds remain after
satisfaction in full of the Obligations, then the remainder shall be returned to
the Borrowers, subject, however, to any other rights or interests any one or
more of the Banks may have therein under any other instrument, agreement or
document or Applicable Law.

          (c) If the amount of all proceeds received with respect to and in
liquidation of the Collateral that shall be applied to payment of the
Obligations shall be insufficient to pay and satisfy all of the Obligations in
full, the Borrowers acknowledge and agree that they shall remain jointly and
severally liable for any deficiency, together with interest thereon and costs of
collection thereof (including reasonable attorneys' disbursements, expenses and
fees), in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments.

          Section 7.08. Performance by the Administrative Agent. In the event
any Borrower fails to pay or otherwise perform or satisfy any of its obligations
to others or under or in respect of any of the Collateral or any other material
asset or property of such Borrower as required by this Agreement or


                                      -79-




<PAGE>



any other Loan Instrument, the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the
Majority Banks, time permitting) shall have the right in its sole and absolute
discretion (but shall be under no duty or obligation) to make any such payment
or cause the performance or satisfaction of any other such obligation, including
(without limitation) the payment of any tax, claim or insurance premium, the
maintenance or defense of any part of the Collateral or the purchase or
discharge of any Lien on any part of the Collateral. The Administrative Agent
will endeavor to give the Borrowers prior notice (which may be by telephone or
telecopy) of any such payment or action; provided, however, that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of the payment or action or the
reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers with respect thereto. The Borrowers
shall pay or reimburse on demand any and all amounts advanced or expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent or its designee under this subsection,
which shall constitute additional Loans under (and secured by) this Agreement
and shall bear interest at the rate applicable to the Loans. No payment made or
action taken by the Administrative Agent, any other Bank or its designee shall
be deemed or construed to be a waiver, cure or satisfaction of the underlying
default, which default shall be deemed to be continuing until such time (if
ever) as the Borrowers have, prior to the Maturity Date, (i) resumed the
payment, performance and satisfaction required by this Agreement and the other
Loan Instruments and (ii) repaid all Loans advanced for such payments and
actions, together with interest thereon, and paid all others to whom the
Administrative Agent has requested direct payment respecting such payments and
actions.

          Section 7.09. Certain Acknowledgments and Waivers by the Borrowers.

          (a) Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the rights, powers,
privileges, remedies and interests granted to or conferred upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank in respect of any of the Collateral by
this Agreement, the other Loan Instruments and Applicable Law are purely
discretionary and shall not, and shall not be deemed or construed to, impose
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Bank any duty or other obligation (A)
to sell, foreclose or otherwise realize upon any of the Collateral, (B) to
protect or preserve any of the Collateral, (C) to perform or satisfy any
obligation under or respecting any of the Collateral or any Borrower, (D) to
mitigate or otherwise reduce any damage or other loss, or (E) to otherwise
exercise or enforce any such right, power, privilege, remedy or interest. Any
sale, foreclosure or other realization upon any of the Collateral, or any other
exercise or enforcement of any such right, power, privilege, remedy or interest,
if undertaken by the Administrative Agent or any other Bank in its discretion
(with the consent of the Requisite Banks as and if required), may be delayed,
discontinued or otherwise not pursued or exhausted for any reason whatsoever
(whether intentionally or otherwise). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent waiver is not limited under Applicable Law, each
Borrower hereby expressly waives each and every claim or defense and agrees that
it will not assert or pursue (by action, suit, counterclaim or otherwise) any
claim or defense, respecting (i) any settlement or compromise with any obligor
or other third party under any Account Receivable, account, note, instrument,
agreement, document or general intangible included in the Collateral,
irrespective of any reduction in the potential proceeds therefrom, (ii) the
selection or order of disposition of any of the Collateral (which may be at
random or in any order(s) the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the
Requisite Banks as and if required) may select in its sole and absolute
discretion), (iii) any private sale of any of the Collateral, whether or not any
public market exists, (iv) the choice or timing of any sale date (which the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if
required) may select in its sole and absolute discretion), irrespective of
whether greater sale proceeds would be realizable on a different sale date, (v)
the adequacy of the sale price of any of the Collateral, (vi) any insufficiency
of the proceeds to fully satisfy the Obligations, (vii) any sale of any of the
Collateral to the first person to receive an offer or make a bid, (viii) the
selection of any purchaser of any of the Collateral, or (ix) any default by any
purchaser of any of the Collateral. Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any
other Bank nor any of their respective representatives shall incur any liability
in connection with any sale of or other action taken respecting any of the
Collateral in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, any other Loan
Instrument or Applicable Law.


                                      -80-




<PAGE>



          (b) Each Borrower hereby expressly waives the applicability of any and
all Applicable Laws respecting collateral or its disposition that are or may be
in conflict with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments now or at any time in the future to the extent waiver is not limited
under Applicable Law, including (without limitation) those pertaining to notice
(other than notices required by this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument),
appraisal, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium, marshaling of assets,
exemption and equity of redemption; provided, however, that the preceding
provision is not intended to confer upon any Bank any right, power, privilege,
remedy or interest not permissible under Applicable Law notwithstanding the
foregoing waivers.

          Section 7.10. Termination of Certain Existing Security Interests. With
respect to all Released Collateral, upon the Effective Date the Borrowers are
authorized to prepare for filing by the Administrative Agent Uniform Commercial
Code partial release statements identifying such Released Collateral, but only
such Released Collateral, and, to the extent same is at any time provided to the
Administrative Agent prior to the Trigger Event and is in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, same shall be filed by the
Administrative Agent promptly after its receipt thereof. Any and all actions
under this Section shall be without any recourse to or representation or
warranty by any Bank (including the Administrative Agent) and shall be at the
sole cost and expense of the Borrowers. IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER OR NOT ANY SUCH PARTIAL RELEASE STATEMENTS ARE FILED BY THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S LIEN IN
SUCH RELEASED COLLATERAL SHALL AUTOMATICALLY BE TERMINATED AND OF NO FURTHER
FORCE OR EFFECT, SUBJECT, HOWEVER, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A TRIGGER EVENT, TO
BEING REINSTATED WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF THE RELEASED COLLATERAL THAT
CONSTITUTES SPRINGING COLLATERAL.

          Section 7.11. Termination of Security Interests. The security
interests granted to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the
Banks) hereunder shall terminate when the Commitments shall have terminated and
the Obligations shall have been fully paid and satisfied. Upon such termination
of the Commitments and such complete payment and satisfaction the shall
reassign, release and/or deliver to the Borrowers all Collateral then held by or
at the direction of the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the
Banks) under the Loan Instruments and the Administrative Agent shall execute and
deliver to the Borrowers for filing in each office in which any financing
statement, mortgage, or lease, or assignment thereof, relating to the
Collateral, or any part thereof, shall have been filed, a termination statement
under the Uniform Commercial Code or an appropriate satisfaction, release,
reconveyance or reassignment releasing the Administrative Agent's interest
therein, and any other instrument or document that the Borrowers deem reasonably
necessary to evidence the termination of the Administrative Agent's security
interest, each in such form and substance as may be acceptable to the
Administrative Agent. Any and all actions under this Section shall be without
any recourse to or representation or warranty by any Bank (including the
Administrative Agent) and shall be at the sole cost and expense of the
Borrowers.

          Section 7.12. Pearl River Collateral. Each Bank expressly agrees that,
notwithstanding any other term, condition or provision of this Agreement,
including without limitation the right of setoff by the Banks, Fleet's Lien on
the Pearl River Collateral, including its Lien on cash and cash equivalents,
shall be senior to the Lien of any Bank in such Pearl River Collateral and any
Lien granted to any Bank by any Borrower in any of the Pearl River Collateral as
collateral security for the Obligations is subordinate (the "Bank Subordinate
Interest") and subject to the security interest in the Pearl River Collateral
granted to Fleet. In this regard, in connection with the Obligations, no Bank
will enforce or apply the Bank Subordinate Interest or in any manner interfere
with Fleet's security interest in the Pearl River Collateral unless and until
the Pearl River Financing L/C shall have expired or been terminated and all
obligations owing to Fleet in connection therewith shall have been paid in full.
The provisions of this

Section 7.12 are only for the benefit of the Banks and Fleet and may not be
relied on or enforced by any Borrower or any other Person.

          levy and execution shall not be effectively stayed or contested in
          good faith;

     (k)  any action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving or affecting
          any Plan or any assets of properties of any Plan shall be adversely
          determined; any fiduciary or sponsor of, or participant in, any Plan

          aggregate with any other such event(s)) has had or could have (in the
          reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent and the Majority
          Banks) an ERISA Effect;

     (l)  any loss, damage, destruction or other material impairment,
          deterioration or diminution, or any termination, foreclosure,
          condemnation or other involuntary disposition, in whole or in part,

          security interest in and actually receives all insurance proceeds with
          respect thereto to the extent required by this Agreement and the other
          Loan Instruments), or the Administrative Agent's perfected security
          interest therein, or any Borrower shall do or fail to do or resist, or
          cause, suffer or permit anyone else to do, anything that would so
          affect any such Collateral or security interest;

     (m)  any Loan Instrument (in whole or in part) at any time and for any

     (n)  any of the Borrowers shall be or become the subject of or a party to
          any criminal conviction in any material respect (other than a
          misdemeanor); or

     (o)  the occurrence of a Change of Control.

          Section 8.02. Remedies upon Default. Upon the occurrence or at any
time thereafter during the continuance of any Event of Default and after the
issuance of a Default Declaration, the Administrative Agent (with the consent of
the Requisite Banks, as and if required), upon notice to the Borrowers (which
may be combined with the Default Declaration), shall be entitled, without
limiting the ability to do so at other times (each Borrower hereby acknowledging
that all Letter of Credit Advances and interest thereon and certain other
Obligations are payable on demand as provided in Article II hereof
notwithstanding anything in this Section or in Section 8.01 to the contrary):
(a) to terminate the Commitment (b) to declare the Loans and all other
Obligations to be immediately due and payable, whether principal, interest or
otherwise, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of an kind (all
of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower), notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement, any Note or any of the other Loan Instruments to
the contrary; (c) to exercise or enforce any one or more of the rights, powers,
privileges, remedies and interests of the Administrative Agent or any


                                      -84-




<PAGE>



other Bank under this Agreement, each Note, the other Loan Instruments and
Applicable Law; and (d) to demand the immediate deposit by any Borrower of cash
Collateral in a non-interest-bearing demand deposit account with the
Administrative Agent or such other institution as the Administrative Agent may
designate in an amount equal to the aggregate unadvanced face amounts of the
Letters of Credit then outstanding in order to further secure repayment of all
advances under the Letters of Credit, together with interest thereon, and all of
the other Obligations in full, which deposits shall remain Collateral until all
of the Letters of Credit have been paid (and the corresponding Letter of Credit
Advances repaid by the Borrowers) or surrendered to the Fronting Bank or the
Administrative Agent for return to and cancellation by the issuers thereof
(provided that any Letter of Credit that has not been presented for payment
shall be deemed for this purpose to have been canceled on the thirtieth day
following the stated expiry date, without, however, relieving the Borrowers of
any of the Obligations with respect to any such Letter of Credit that is in the
process of payment) and all of the other Obligations have been fully paid and
satisfied, and which obligation to deposit is itself secured by the Collateral
pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments; provided, however,
that in the event of the occurrence of any of the Events of Default respecting
any Borrower set forth in subsections (h) and (l) of Section 8.01, then
simultaneously with that event, and without the necessity of any notice or other
action by the Administrative Agent or the other Banks, (i) the Commitment shall
be terminated, (ii) the Loans and all of the other Obligations shall be
accelerated and immediately due and payable as stated above, and (iii) the
Borrowers shall be required to make the deposit of the additional cash
Collateral further securing the Letters of Credit and the other Obligations as
provided above. If the Borrowers have not delivered the cash Collateral
specified above within five (5) Business Days after it was due, at any time and
from time to time thereafter the Banks in their sole and absolute discretion may
(but shall not be obligated to) advance to the Borrowers all or any portion of
the required cash Collateral, by credit to any accounts of the Borrowers with
the Administrative Agent or otherwise; and amounts advanced by the Banks
pursuant to this option and outstanding from time to time shall be due and
payable, together with interest and additional interest thereon at the rates
provided in Section 2.04 of this Agreement, ON DEMAND, and shall otherwise
constitute "Letter of Credit Advances" for all purposes under this Agreement and
the other Loan Instruments.

          Section 8.03. Enforcement, Etc. The Administrative Agent (with the
consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required), in its or their sole
discretion, may proceed to exercise or enforce any right, power, privilege,
remedy or interest that the Administrative Agent or any other Bank may have
under this Agreement, any other Loan Instrument or Applicable Law at law, in
equity, in rem or in any other forum available under Applicable Law; without
notice except as otherwise expressly provided herein; without pursuing,
exhausting or otherwise exercising or enforcing any other right, power,
privilege, remedy or interest that the Administrative Agent or any other Bank
may have against or in respect of any Borrower, the Collateral, or any other
co-obligor, guarantor, sum, pledgor, collateral or other person or thing;
without regard to any act or omission of the Administrative Agent, any other
Bank or any other person, and without delivery to any Borrower or any other
person or production in any action, suit or proceeding of any consent or
approval of one or more of the Banks required under this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument (without, however, in any way limiting the rights and remedies
of any Bank thereunder against the Administrative Agent or any other Bank), and
no Borrower will raise, and each Borrower hereby waives, any objection or
defense respecting the need for any such delivery or production. The
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if
required) may institute one or more proceedings (which may be separate
proceedings) with respect to this Agreement and each of the other Loan
Instruments in such order and at such times as may be selected in its or their
sole and absolute discretion. This Agreement and the other Loan Instruments may
be enforced without possession of any Note or its production in any action, suit
or proceeding. This Agreement and the other Loan Instruments may be enforced
with respect to any Borrower without the presence or participation of any other
Borrower, or any other co-obligor (joint or several), guarantor, pledgor or
surety, whether through lack of jurisdiction, venue or service or otherwise, and
no Borrower will raise, and each Borrower


                                      -85-




<PAGE>



hereby expressly waives, any objection or defense respecting the need for any,
such presence or participation.

          Section 8.04. Equitable Relief. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees
that it may be impossible to measure in money the damage to the Banks in the
event of a breach of or default under any of the terms and provisions of
Sections 6.04, 6.05. 6.07, 6.08, 6.09, 7.03, 7.05, 7.07(a) and 8.02(d) of this
Agreement, and that, in the event of any such breach or default, the
Administrative Agent, in addition to all other rights, powers, privileges and
remedies that the Administrative Agent or any other Bank may have, shall be
entitled to injunctive relief, specific performance or such other equitable
relief as the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as
and if required), may request to exercise or otherwise enforce any of the terms
and provisions of those Sections and to enjoin or otherwise restrain any act
prohibited thereby, and no Borrower will raise, and each Borrower hereby
expressly waives, any objection or defense that there is an adequate remedy
available at law.

          Section 8.05. Consent to Jurisdiction Waiver of Personal Service, Etc.
Each Borrower hereby consents and agrees that the Supreme Court of the State of
New York for the County of Nassau and the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York each shall have personal jurisdiction and proper
venue with respect to any dispute between the Administrative Agent (or any other
Bank) and any Borrower under any Loan Instrument; provided that the foregoing
consent shall not deprive the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Banks) of
the right in its sole discretion to voluntarily commence or participate in any
action, suit or proceeding in any other court having jurisdiction and venue over
any Borrower. In any dispute with the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, no
Borrower will raise, and each Borrower hereby expressly waives, any objection or
defense to any such jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum. Without in any way
limiting the preceding consents to jurisdiction and venue, the parties intend
(among other things) to thereby avail themselves of the benefit of Section
5-1402 of the General Obligations Law of the State of New York. Each Borrower
hereby expressly waives personal service of any summons, complaint or other
process, which may be delivered by any of the means permitted for notices under
Section 10.01 hereof. In addition (and without limitation of any such delivery
or any other delivery permitted under Applicable Law), each Borrower has
executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Designation of
Administrative Agent for Service appointing Kramer, Coleman, Wactlar &
Lieberman, P.C., as the agent of such Borrower for service in the State of New
York, which each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent
to date with such date (if undated) and file with the appropriate Authority at
such time as the Administrative Agent in its discretion (with the consent of the
Requisite Banks, as and if required) may elect. Within thirty (30) days after
service of process, each Borrower agrees to appear or answer any summons or
complaint of the Banks, or the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Banks),
and should such Borrower fail to appear or answer within said thirty-day period,
such Borrower shall be deemed in default under that action and judgment may be
requested by the Administrative Agent and entered in favor of the Banks against
such Borrower for the relief demanded in any complaint so served. Each Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that a final judgment in any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be conclusive and binding upon such Borrower and may be
enforced against such Borrower or any of its assets or properties in any other
appropriate jurisdiction selected by the Administrative Agent in its discretion
(with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required) by an action, suit
or proceeding in such other jurisdiction. To the extent that any Borrower may be
entitled to immunity (whether by reason of sovereigns or otherwise) from suit in
any jurisdiction, from the jurisdiction of any court or from any other legal
process, each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably waives such immunity.

          Section 8.06. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH BORROWER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT, THE FRONTING BANK AND EACH BANK MUTUALLY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, IN EACH CASE IN RESPECT OF
ANY CLAIM BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF,


                                      -86-




<PAGE>



UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES AND/OR ANY OTHER LOAN
INSTRUMENTS CONTEMPLATED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS
OF ANY PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
THE FRONTING BANK AND/OR ANY BANK RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE LOAN INSTRUMENTS AND AGREE THAT NO
PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A
JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH BORROWER CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING BANK
OR ANY BANK HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PERSON WOULD NOT,
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER. THIS WAIVER
CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE FRONTING
BANK AND EACH BANK TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, ACCEPT THE NOTES AND MAKE THE
EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT.

          Section 8.07. Waiver of Setoff, Special Damages, Etc.

          (a) Each Borrower hereby expressly waives, and agrees that it will not
exercise, any and all rights of setoff, recoupment, abatement or reduction
respecting any payment due (whether as scheduled or required, upon acceleration
or as sought in any action, suit or proceeding by any Bank) under this
Agreement, any other Loan Instrument or any other agreement, facility or
relationship with the Administrative Agent or any other Bank that may now or
hereafter be accorded to such Borrower under Applicable Law or otherwise. To the
extent not required as a compulsory counterclaim in any related ongoing
proceeding, each Borrower (i) shall pursue separate exercise and enforcement of
any right, power, privilege, remedy or interest retained (and not waived) by
such Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Instruments, any other
agreement, facility or relationship with the Administrative Agent or any other
Bank and Applicable Law, and (ii) shall not seek to exercise or enforce any such
right, power, privilege, remedy or interest in any proceeding instituted by the
Administrative Agent or any of the other Banks under or in respect of any Loan
Instrument, whether through joinder, consolidation, setoff, recoupment,
abatement, reduction, counterclaim, defense or otherwise.

          (b) In any dispute with the Administrative Agent or any other Bank,
each Borrower covenants and agrees that it will not seek, recover or retain any,
and each Borrower each hereby expressly waives any and all, special, exemplary,
punitive and/or consequential damages (whether through action, suit,
counterclaim or otherwise) to the extent waiver is not limited under Applicable
Law.

          Section 8.08. No Fiduciary Relationship, Etc. Each Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that its sole relationship with the Administrative
Agent, the Fronting Bank and Banks is that of debtor and creditor, respectively,
and that no term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument is
intended to create, nor shall any such term or provision be deemed or construed
to have created, any joint venture, partnership, trust, agency or other
fiduciary relationship with any Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Borrower. Each
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Borrowers have independently and fully
reviewed and evaluated the Loan Instruments, the transactions contemplated
thereunder and the potential effects of such transactions on the assets,
business, operations, properties and condition (financial or otherwise) of each
of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, which review and evaluation was made
(i) together with counsel and (to the extent deemed prudent by the Borrowers)
financial and other advisors to the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and (ii)
without any reliance upon any oral or written advice, analysis or assurance of
any kind whatsoever from the Administrative Agent or any other Bank.

<PAGE>



          Section 8.09. Banks' Right of Setoff, Etc. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Bank hereby is authorized
at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Borrowers (any such
notice being hereby expressly waived by each Borrower), to setoff upon and
against all deposits, credits, collateral and property of any Borrower, now or
hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of such Bank or any
entity under the control of any Person that owns the Capital Stock of such Bank
and its successors or assigns, or in transit to any of them, or any part thereof
and any Indebtedness or other amount or obligation (including, without
limitation, any obligation under any interest rate protection, foreign currency
exchange or other interest rate or exchange rate swap or hedging agreement or
arrangement) and apply the same to any of the Obligations even though unmatured
and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing the Obligations.
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE A BANK TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH
RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS, PRIOR TO
EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER
PROPERTY OF THE BORROWER ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVED. The foregoing rights shall apply whether or not the Administrative Agent
or any other Bank shall have declared a default, accelerated the obligations or
made any demand or taken any other action under this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each
Borrower acknowledges that pursuant to Section 7.01 hereof it granted to the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of all of the Banks) a senior security
interest in and to, among other things, all such deposits, assets, properties
and Indebtedness in the possession of each of the affiliates, custodians,
participants and designees of each Bank, and each Borrower hereby authorizes
each such person to so set off and apply such amounts at such times and in such
manner as the Administrative Agent may direct pursuant to this Section, in each
case to the fullest extent possible as if the person making the setoff were a
direct creditor of such Borrower in the full amount of the Obligations. The
debiting Bank shall notify the Borrowers after any such setoff and application;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application. In debiting any such account, the
Obligations shall be deemed to have been paid or repaid only to the extent of
the funds actually available in that account notwithstanding any internal
procedure of the debiting Bank or any of its affiliates, custodians,
participants and designees to the contrary. The rights of the Administrative
Agent and the other Banks under this Section are in addition to and without
limitation of any other rights, powers, privileges, remedies and other interests
(including, without limitation, other rights of setoff and security interests)
that the Administrative Agent or the other Banks may have under this Agreement,
the other Loan Instruments and Applicable Law. IT IS EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND
AGREED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THAT CERTAIN OF THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THIS
SECTION 8.09 IS ALSO SPRINGING COLLATERAL, THE RIGHTS GRANTED TO EACH BANK UNDER
THIS SECTION 8.09 SHALL NOT BE DEPENDENT ON THE OCCURRENCE OF A TRIGGER EVENT
AND, UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT,
EACH BANK SHALL HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THIS SECTION 8.09 WHETHER
OR NOT ANY TRIGGER EVENT SHALL HAVE OCCURRED AND WHETHER OR NOT SAME ARE BEING
EXERCISED DURING ANY TRIGGER PERIOD.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                     The Administrative Agent and the Banks

          Section 9.01. Appointment of Administrative Agent. Upon the terms and
provisions and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the Banks
hereby appoint Fleet to act as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments, and Fleet hereby accepts such appointment.

          Section 9.02. Undivided Interest and Committed Share, Etc.

          (a) Upon the terms and provisions and subject to the conditions
contained in this Article, the Banks agree that each has an undivided interest
in the Loans and other Obligations under this Agreement and the obligations of
the Borrowers and the other parties (other than the Banks) under the other Loan
Instruments (collectively, the "Loan Obligations"), any asset or property
securing the Loan Obligations, whether through pledge, attachment, mortgage or
otherwise (the "Loan Collateral"), and the rights, powers, privileges, remedies
and interests of the Banks in and to this Agreement and other Loan Instruments,
as well as the risks, liabilities and expenses related thereto, such that each
Bank shall have and be committed to an undivided fractional interest therein and
in the Commitment, Revolving Credit Loans and related items equal to the
respective maximum principal amounts and percentages set forth on Exhibit E
hereto, as the same may be recomputed from time to time to reflect departing or
additional Banks pursuant to this Agreement (which undivided fractional interest
will be referred to as such Bank's "Committed Share" of the Commitment, or the
Mortgage Loans, as applicable).

          (b) With respect to payments made to the Administrative Agent
(generally following the circumstances described in Section 2.07(a) herein) the
Administrative Agent will mark its books and records to reflect the respective
interests of the Banks, all payments received from and made to each Bank from
time to time pursuant to this Agreement may be recorded by the Administrative
Agent, and such records shall be presumptively correct as to the existence and
amounts thereof absent manifest error.

          (c) "Pro Rata Share" at a particular time for a particular Bank shall
mean a share of the referenced item proportional to the percentage obtained by
dividing (A) that portion of the principal balance then outstanding under the
referenced Loans attributable to principal amounts received by one or more of
the Borrowers from such Bank (or its predecessor) under this Agreement or any
other Loan Instrument (including those made under the Existing Loan Agreement
and other Existing Loan Instruments) and not theretofore repaid, by (B) the
aggregate principal balance then outstanding under the referenced Loans;
provided that if there is no principal balance then outstanding under the
referenced Loans (or deemed outstanding as provided in this subsection) and with
respect to each outstanding Letter of Credit, a Bank's Pro Rata Share shall be
equal to (1) its Committed Share of the Mortgage Loans with respect to the
Mortgage Loans, and (2) its Committed Share of the Commitment (i.e., the
Revolving Credit Loans) with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans and the
Letters of Credit.

          (d) "Majority Banks" at a particular time shall mean the Banks (which
may include the Administrative Agent) then having an aggregate Pro Rata Share of
at least 61%.

          Section 9.03. Notice of Intent Not to Advance, Letters of Credit.

          (a) In the event a Bank determines that it will not make its Committed
Share of any Advance requested by the Borrowers, such Bank shall immediately
notify the other Banks by telephone and telecopy of a signed notice, and shall
promptly confirm such notice by delivery to each of the other Banks of an
original copy of such signed notice, which notice shall specify the Bank's
reasons (if any) for such decision. No Bank, however, may refuse to make any
payment under its Letter of Credit Participation (as hereinafter defined), which
each Bank acknowledges and agrees will result in additional Advances of
Revolving Credit Loans.

          (b) By the issuance or extension of any Letter of Credit, the Fronting
Bank hereby sells and grants (and continues, in the case of each existing Letter
of Credit) to each Bank, and each Bank hereby unconditionally purchases and
acquires (and continues, in the case of each existing Letter of Credit) from the
Fronting Bank, without any further action on the part of the Fronting Bank or
acquiring


                                      -89-

Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Bank's Committed
Share of the face amount of such Letter of Credit (each a "Letter of Credit
Participation"), effective upon the issuance or extension of such Letter of
Credit (or on the Effective Date in the case of each existing Letter of Credit).
In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Bank hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, on
behalf of each Fronting Bank, in accordance with subsection (c) below, such
Bank's Pro Rata Share of each unreimbursed Letter of Credit Advance made by the
Fronting Bank; provided however, that the Banks shall not be obligated to make
any such payment with respect to any wrongful payment or disbursement made under
any Letter of Credit as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Fronting Bank.

          (c) If the Fronting Bank (other than the Administrative Agent) has
directly billed the Borrowers for a Letter of Credit Advance as permitted by
Section 9.05(a) hereof and has not received from the Borrowers the payment
required by Section 2.07(d) hereof by 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day
such payment is due, the Fronting Bank will promptly notify the Administrative
Agent of the Letter of Credit Advance and such non-receipt of payment. If the
Borrowers have not previously requested an Advance and complied with the related
conditions in order to fund such payment, the Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Bank of such Letter of Credit Advance and its Pro Rata Share
thereof. Each such unreimbursed payment made in accordance with Section 2.07(d)
hereof shall for all purposes hereunder be deemed to be an Advance of a
Revolving Credit Loan. Each Bank will pay to the Administrative Agent, by not
later than 4:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such date (or, if the Banks shall
have received such notice later than 2:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such
date, then by not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the immediately
following Business Day), an amount equal to such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such
Letter of Credit Advance (it being understood and agreed that such amount shall
constitute funding of an Advance of a Revolving Credit Loan by each such Bank),
and the Administrative Agent will promptly pay such amount to the Fronting Bank.
If any Bank shall not have made its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit
Advance available to the Fronting Bank as provided above, such Bank agrees to
pay interest on such amount, for each day from and including the date such
amount is required to be paid in accordance with this subsection to but
excluding the date an amount equal to such amount is paid to the Administrative
Agent for prompt payment to the Fronting Bank at the Federal Funds Rate for the
first such day and at the rate applicable to Loans under Section 2.04(a) hereof
for each day thereafter.

          (d) Each Bank acknowledges and agrees that each Letter of Credit
Participation and its payment and other obligations with respect thereto: (i) is
absolute and unconditional; (ii) shall remain and continue in full force and
effect without regard (A) to any waiver, modification, extension, renewal,
amendment or restatement of any other term or provision of any Letter of Credit,
(B) to any act or circumstance respecting any Letter of Credit consented to or
waived by any Borrower under Section 2.07 hereto, (C) to any full, partial or
non-exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests of
the Fronting Bank respecting any Letter of Credit or under any related
application, any Loan Instrument or Applicable Law, against any person or with
respect to any Collateral, (D) to any release or subordination of any
Obligations or Collateral, (E) to any statute of limitations or similar time
constraint under any Applicable Law, (F) to any investigation, analysis or
evaluation by any Bank or its designees of the assets, business, operations,
properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of any Borrower (whether in its
capacity as a Borrower or a guarantor) or any other Person, (G) to any Default
or Event of Default, whenever occurring or continuing, (H) to any act or
omission on the part of the Fronting Bank, the Administrative Agent, any Bank or
any other person, or (I) to any other event that otherwise might constitute a
legal or equitable counterclaim, defense or discharge of a participant or
surety; (iii) shall not be subject to any defense, counterclaim, set off, right
of recoupment, abatement, reduction or other claim or determination that such
Bank may have against the Administrative Agent, the Fronting Bank, any other
Bank, any Borrower or any other Person; (iv) shall not be diminished or
qualified by the death, disability, dissolution, reorganization, insolvency,
bankruptcy, custodianship or receivership of the Fronting Bank,


                                      -90-




<PAGE>



the participating Bank, any Borrower, any other co-obligor, guarantor, surety or
pledgor or any other Person, or the inability of any of them to pay its debts or
perform or otherwise satisfy its obligations as they become due for any reason
whatsoever; and (v) shall not be affected by any other circumstance whatsoever.

          Section 9.04. Collection and Distribution.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, each Bank shall be
entitled from time to time to a share of all payments of principal, interest,
commitment and other fees and other amounts received in respect of the Loan
Obligations, as well as the net proceeds from all Loan Collateral, which share
for a particular Bank at any particular time shall be: (i) its Pro Rata Share of
all principal payments on the Revolving Credit Loans, Mortgage Loans or other
Loans to which any voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments are to be
applied; (ii) its Pro Rata Share of interest paid on the Revolving Credit Loans,
Mortgage Loans or other Loans to which the payments relate, which shall be
adjusted to reflect any rate differentials among the Banks so as to approximate
the amounts that would have resulted from direct billings; (iii) its Committed
Share of the Commitment Fee and other fees respecting Loans in which it shares;
(iv) its Pro Rata Share of all net proceeds and other amounts received from the
Loan Collateral following acceleration of the Loans and (v) its Pro Rata Share
of all other amounts received in respect of the Loan Obligations.

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, no other
Bank shall be entitled to any share of: (i) any amount that may be directly
billed in accordance with Section 9.05 hereof, subject to the terms and
provisions of such Section; (ii) any payment, reimbursement or other indemnity
to the Administrative Agent or any other indemnified person under this Agreement
or any other Loan Instrument with respect to any claims, liabilities, losses or
expenses not theretofore funded by the claiming Bank(s); (iii) any
administrative or other fees payable to the Administrative Agent in accordance
with Section 2.06 or 10.13(b) of this Agreement or pursuant to a separate
writing agreement between the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers; (iv) any
payment under or other right respecting any Independent Transaction (as defined
in Section 9.17(b) hereof); (v) any payment to any Fronting Bank of any and all
customary fees (other than the Letter of Credit Fee), commissions and/or charges
of the Fronting Bank for any increase, extension, renewal, amendment or transfer
of any, of its Letter of Credit and any fees or other charges of any other
issuer or any participant, correspondent, confirming bank, custodian or designee
of the Fronting Bank or other issuer involved with the Letter of Credit; or (vi)
any exercise by a Bank or its affiliates of their respective rights of setoff or
banker's Lien with respect to an Independent Transaction against any general
deposits, assets and properties (other than Loan Collateral) of any Borrower or
any other Person. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided in this Article, any
payment received in respect of the obligation (if any) of the Borrowers to
reimburse the Banks for certain increased costs and reduced receipts under
Section 2.04 of this Agreement, as well as any net proceeds from Loan Collateral
to be applied to such Loan Obligations, shall be shared by the Banks in
proportion to their respective increased costs and reduced receipts.

          (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the Administrative
Agent shall receive all payments of principal and other distributable amounts in
respect of the Loan Obligations, all net proceeds realized from the Loan
Collateral and all amounts received by the Banks and delivered to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Article, and the
Administrative Agent shall hold each such amount in an account for the benefit
of all of the Banks until distributed as hereinafter provided. As soon as
practicable after each such receipt, the Administrative Agent shall determine
the respective amounts to be distributed and promptly thereafter shall credit to
itself the amount to which it is entitled and wire the amounts to which the
other Banks are entitled to them in accordance with the instructions annexed as
Exhibit F hereto, or in accordance with such subsequent written instruction (in
substantially the same form) as a Bank from time to time may deliver to the
Administrative Agent.


                                      -91-




<PAGE>



          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks
hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in
full to the Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Bank on such
due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent
the Borrowers shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such amount distributed to such Bank together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank until the date such
Bank repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

          (e) Each Bank agrees that if it shall receive or otherwise obtain any
Excess Amount in any Payment Event (as such terms are hereinafter defined), such
Bank (the "Receiving Bank"): (i) shall (except as otherwise permitted by this
Article) receive and hold such Excess Amount in trust for the benefit of all of
the Banks and promptly deliver such Excess Amount to the Administrative Agent;
and (ii) shall in all other cases be deemed (simultaneously with such Payment
Event) to have purchased from each other Bank (a "Selling Bank") at face value,
and shall promptly pay to each Selling Bank the purchase price for, a
participation in the Revolving Credit Loans, Mortgage Loans or Letter of Credit,
as applicable, in the amount(s) necessary so that the Pro Rata Shares of the
Receiving Bank and each Selling Bank with respect thereto (taking into account
such participations as if they were assignments) are maintained at the same
percentage after such Payment Event as they were before such Payment Event. If
any such participation shall be purchased pursuant to this subsection by a
Receiving Bank and a Selling Bank shall thereafter recover, receive or otherwise
obtain from or in respect of any Borrower any Excess Amount when compared to the
Receiving Bank, such participation shall be deemed to have been repurchased by
the Selling Bank at face value to the extent of such later Excess Amount
allocable to the Receiving Bank, without interest, and if the Excess Amount so
recovered, received or otherwise obtained by such Selling Bank exceeds the
amount necessary to restore the Banks' respective Pro Rata Shares then such
excess itself shall be treated as an Excess Amount under this subsection. Each
Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any
Bank holding a participation in a Revolving Credit Loan, Mortgage Loans or
Letter of Credit deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and all
rights of banker's Lien, set off or counterclaim with respect to any and all
moneys owing by such Borrower to such Bank by reason thereof as fully as if such
Bank had made a Revolving Credit Loan or Mortgage Loans or issued a Letter of
Credit as applicable, directly to such Borrower in the amount of such
participation. "Excess Amount" shall mean the amount by which: (A) any payment
or amount received or otherwise obtained by any Bank in respect of any Revolving
Credit Loans, Mortgage Loans or Letter of Credit, whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, banker's Lien,
counterclaim or otherwise, or pursuant to any secured claim under Section 506 of
Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from,
or in lieu of, such secured claim received by such Bank under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise (any of which may be
referred to as a "Payment Event"), exceeds (B) the portion of such payment or
amount that would have maintained such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Revolving
Credit Loans, Mortgage Loans or Letters of Credit at the same percentage after
such Payment Event as it was before such Payment Event; provided, however that
Excess Amount shall not include any amount that a Bank (l) is expressly
permitted to receive and retain hereunder, (2) receives from the assignment of
or sale of a participation in any Revolving Credit Loans, Mortgage Loans or
Letter of Credit to anyone other than any Borrower or its affiliates, or (3)
receives or otherwise obtains in any Independent Transaction.

          Section 9.05. Direct Billing, Fixed Rates, Additional Interest, Etc.

          (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, so long as it has not
received notice from the Administrative Agent to the contrary (as contemplated
in Section 2.07(a) hereof or in the proviso


                                      -92-




<PAGE>



below), each Bank may directly bill, receive and retain payment of: (i) the
interest due it under Sections 2.04(a), (b) and (c) hereof with respect to its
Pro Rata Share of the Loans (based upon the Base Rate or Fixed Rate); (ii) any
compensation due it respecting increased costs, reduced receipts and capital
adequacy under Sections 2.04(d), (f) and (i) hereof, (iii) any principal amount
due it as a Fronting Bank respecting any Letter of Credit Advance (other than to
the extent converted into an actual or deemed Revolving Credit Loan), and any
and all customary fees (other than the Letter of Credit Fee), commissions and/or
charges of the Fronting Bank for any increase, extension, renewal, amendment or
transfer of the Letter of Credit and any fees or other charges of any other
issuer or any participant, correspondent, confirming bank, custodian or designee
of the Fronting Bank or other issuer involved with the Letter of Credit; and
(iv) any expense reimbursement due it under Section 10.03 hereof; provided,
however, that the Administrative Agent shall also have the right in its
discretion from time to time to elect (by written notice) to bill and receive
any one or more of the foregoing items on behalf of any Bank other than Chase or
Fleet. If a Bank has not received payment of any amount billed directly under
this provision as and when due under the Loan Agreement, such Bank shall give
prompt notice thereof to the other Banks, as well as prompt notice of any
payment subsequently received.

          (b) If any Bank receives less than full payment of any directly billed
amount, and after communication with the Borrowers any amount remains unpaid,
such Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the other Banks. If
the Banks did not suffer such payment shortfalls ratably, the Administrative
Agent shall immediately give notice to the Banks to cease direct billing and
collection (as contemplated in Section 2.07(a) hereof and subsection (c) below),
and the Banks shall deliver all such disproportionate payments to the
Administrative Agent for redistribution to the Banks in accordance with the
sharing provisions of this Agreement.

          (c) If any Bank has received notice from the Administrative Agent that
it may no longer receive and retain direct payments from the Borrowers as
contemplated in subsection (a) of this Section, such Bank thereafter shall (i)
direct the Borrowers to make all payments to the Administrative Agent, (ii)
receive and hold any payment or other amount received from or for the benefit of
the Borrowers (whether as a result of past bills or otherwise) in trust for the
benefit of all of the Banks and (iii) promptly deliver all such amounts to the
Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent directs otherwise, the
Banks shall continue to render bills and statements to the Borrowers as
contemplated in subsection (a) of this Section, which shall contain the
direction to make all payments to the Administrative Agent; and shall
concurrently send a copy of such bills to the Administrative Agent. If any Bank
has been receiving payments from the Borrowers through account debits, then
unless the Administrative Agent directs otherwise, such Bank shall continue to
debit the accounts of the Borrowers for such payments but shall hold in trust
and promptly deliver the proceeds to the Administrative Agent as provided above.

          (d) Any Bank in its discretion may elect to impose or waive the
additional interest due to it on any late payment as provided in Section 2.04(c)
hereof.

          (e) No Bank may unilaterally impose the additional interest during a
default as provided by Section 2.04(d) of this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent shall be responsible for the imposition and billing of such additional
interest, which imposition prior to the Maturity Date shall require the prior
written consent (which may be sent by telecopy) of the Majority Banks. The
imposition of such additional interest may be rescinded or waived with the
approval (which may be sent by telecopy) of the Majority Banks. The
Administrative Agent also may rescind or waive any such additional interest if
the underlying default is cured within ten Business Days of the date it became a
default (after the expiration of all applicable grace periods).

          Section 9.06. Voting Rights, Etc.

<PAGE>



          (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any, other Loan
Instrument, the prior written consent of each affected Bank shall be required
for any action that would (i) modify the calculation, decrease the amount,
extend the Revolving Credit Period, extend the due date or waive any nonpayment
of any payment of principal, interest or fees under any Loan Instrument, (ii)
release or subordinate any interest under any Loan Instrument in any material
part of the Loan Collateral other than (A) in accordance with Section 9.07(b) of
this Agreement, (B) in connection with any disposition pursuant to Section 9.09
of this Agreement, or (C) as otherwise required, contemplated or permitted by
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, (iii) release any Borrower or any
guarantor, surety or pledgor from personal liability under any Loan Instrument,
(iv) waive any conditions precedent to an Advance under Article IV of this
Agreement (without, however, in any way limiting the ability of the Majority
Banks to waive or consent to any matter within their power or the ability of the
Administrative Agent in its discretion to waive any of the technical conditions
precedent imposed by Article II of this Agreement), or (v) alter any Bank's
Committed Share or the manner of determining any Bank's Pro Rata Share.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, the prior written consent of the Majority Banks shall be required
for any action that would (A) waive any Event of Default, (B) waive or consent
to any departure from any other term or provision of this Agreement, any Note or
any other Loan Instrument signed by the Banks, or (C) otherwise amend or restate
this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan Instrument signed by the Banks;
provided that the Administrative Agent in its discretion nevertheless from time
to time (i) may waive (in whole or in part) any of the technical conditions
precedent to any Advance or Fixed Rate election imposed by Article II hereof and
(ii) may grant temporary waivers or consents respecting the late delivery of
notices, financial statements and similar documents and consent to
non-substantive changes in the form thereof.

          (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but shall be under no
duty or obligation) to make any and all decisions with respect to the terms and
provisions of the Loan Instruments other than those requiring the approval of
the affected Banks or the Majority Banks, including (without limitation) the
right to give any notice, to otherwise communicate with any Borrower or any
guarantor, surety or pledgor under any Loan Instrument and to waive or consent
to any departure from any of those terms or provisions, all without notice to or
consent from any Bank.

          (d) Each Bank shall be bound by such notices, consents, waivers,
releases, supplements, modifications, amendments, restatements and other
agreements and communications as so made by the Administrative Agent or the
Majority Banks, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Requisite
Banks, as and if required to the same extent as if each Bank had been a party
thereto. A separate consent from a Bank shall not be required for any document
signed by it.

          Section 9.07. Powers and Duties of the Administrative Agent, Etc.

          (a) With the consent of the Requisite Banks (if any) specified in this
Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, the Administrative Agent from time to
time in its discretion may exercise or otherwise enforce any right, power,
privilege, remedy or interest under this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments and Applicable Law, and shall perform all duties specifically
required of it by the terms of this Article, in all cases together with such
rights, powers, privileges and remedies as are incidental thereto, and all in
accordance with the usual practices employed by the Administrative Agent in the
servicing of loans of a similar nature for its own account. The other Loan
Instruments may be executed and delivered by the Administrative Agent in the
name of the Banks, the Administrative Agent or a nominee, each Note may be made
payable severally to the Banks or solely to the order of the Administrative
Agent or its nominee, and the originals (or original counterparts) of each Note,
one set of


                                      -94-




<PAGE>



this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, and all other documents, reports
and communications respecting the Loan Instruments delivered to or from any
Borrower or any other guarantor, surety or pledgor shall be held by the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of all of the Banks in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Article, which items may be held by the
Administrative Agent or its designee and from time to time warehoused or
disposed of in accordance with the usual practices employed by the
Administrative Agent.

          (b) To the extent possession of the Loan Collateral may be required or
permitted under any of the Loan Instruments, the Administrative Agent shall hold
such Loan Collateral as collateral agent for the other Banks, including (without
limitation) any deposits with the Administrative Agent of the Borrowers, any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or any other guarantor, surety or pledgor under
any Loan Instrument, or in instances where a Bank (other than the Administrative
Agent) holds funds constituting Loan Collateral in local operating or other
accounts of any such person(s), such Bank shall act as collateral agent for any
other Bank; provided that the deposits and other accounts of any such person(s)
need not be blocked or otherwise restricted as to access unless (i) specifically
required with respect to a specified account by this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, or (ii) directed by the Majority Banks. The Administrative Agent
also may be designated as the secured party for the purpose of any Uniform
Commercial Code, mortgage or other filing. Each such collateral agency shall be
for the limited purpose of perfecting the Banks' security interest in the Loan
Collateral for the benefit of the Banks and shall be subject to the rights of
the Banks and the pledgors under the relevant Loan Instruments. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, the
Administrative Agent shall have the right (but shall be under no duty or
obligation) to administer the Loan Collateral and the security interests with
respect thereto in such manner as the Administrative Agent may deem necessary or
desirable. The Administrative Agent, without notice to or consent from any Bank,
from time to time may execute and deliver releases, subordinations,
satisfactions, assignments, reassignments and similar instruments and documents
in respect of any Loan Collateral and take any other action that may be
necessary or desirable in connection therewith so long as such instruments,
documents or actions are require, contemplated or permitted by the terms and
provisions of the relevant Loan Instrument(s).

          (c) Without limiting its right to do so in its discretion, the
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take or
continue any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument unless the
Administrative Agent first shall be reimbursed or otherwise indemnified to its
reasonable satisfaction (which may include the deposit of funds) by the Banks
(other than itself) in accordance with their respective Committed Shares against
any and all liabilities and expenses that the Administrative Agent reasonably
estimates may be incurred by the Administrative Agent by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

          Section 9.08. Notices and Knowledge of Events of Default, Etc.

          (a) Each Bank shall give prompt notice to the other Banks of the
occurrence and continuance of any Event of Default, unless it reasonably
believes that notice was sent directly to the other Banks, to the extent any
officer of such Bank active with respect to any Borrower's account: (i) obtains
actual knowledge of any such event; or (ii) receives specific notice of any such
event from any Borrower or any other person. Each Bank shall be entitled to
assume that no Event of Default or other event that, with or without the giving
of notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, unless: (A) the officers of such Bank active
with respect to any Borrower's account have obtained actual knowledge of such an
event, or (B) notice has been given to such Bank by any Borrower or another Bank
specifically stating its belief that such an event has occurred and is
continuing and specifying the nature thereof.


                                      -95-




<PAGE>



          (b) At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, the Administrative Agent may (but shall be under no duty or
obligation to), or upon the written consent or direction of the Majority Banks
the Administrative Agent shall, give the Borrowers a written Default Declaration
expressly declaring that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
giving a copy of such notice to the other Banks; provided that the failure to
send such copy to any Bank shall not affect the validity of any such notice of
declaration of an Event of Default. The Administrative Agent and each of the
other Banks (individually or collectively) also may communicate with the
Borrowers and the other Banks respecting any Event of Default or potential
resolution, which shall not be deemed or construed to be a Default Declaration
(which may only be made by Default Declaration respecting an Event of Default).
If any Event of Default shall have occurred and continued after notice to the
Administrative Agent for more than three (3) Business Days respecting any
payment default or for more than ten (10) Business Days respecting any other
default requiring the approval of the Majority Banks or all of the Banks for
waiver, then the Majority Banks may direct the Administrative Agent to send the
Default Declaration to the Borrowers by giving the Administrative Agent a signed
notice of their request, or by giving the Administrative Agent notice of their
request by telecopy of a signed notice and promptly confirming their request by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of the original signed notice (which may be
in counterparts).

          (c) At any time during the continuance of any Event of Default
declared pursuant to subsection (b), above, whether or not the Administrative
Agent or the Majority Banks shall have declared a default, accelerated the
maturity of any of the Loan Obligations or taken any other action with respect
thereto, all amounts received by a Bank from or with respect to the Loan
Obligations, whether through payment, the exercise of any right of setoff in
respect of any Loan Obligation or Loan Collateral, or otherwise, shall be
received in trust by such Bank for the benefit of all of the Banks and promptly
delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          (d) At any time during the continuance of any Event of Default
declared in any Default Declaration, any Bank shall have the absolute and
unconditional right (but shall be under no duty or obligation) to purchase at
any time the entire interest of any or more of the other Banks in the Loan
Obligations, Loan Collateral and Loan Instruments and under this Agreement and
the other Loan Instruments, exercisable by written notice to the other Bank(s),
and effective upon payment to each such Bank of its Pro Rata Share of the Loans,
together with interest thereon, following which such Bank(s) shall have no
further right, interest or obligation in the Loan Obligations, Loan Collateral
and Loan Instruments. The Committed Share and Pro Rata Share of the purchasing
Bank shall be adjusted to reflect any such repurchase. No Bank shall have any
liability or obligation to indemnify or reimburse the Administrative Agent for
any such purchase or any part thereof.

          Section 9.09. Administration During Certain Events of Default.

          (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent shall consult with the Banks to determine a
course of action with respect to that Event of Default acceptable to the
Majority Banks. Once determined, the Administrative Agent shall use reasonable
efforts to pursue that course of action in a manner consistent with and
otherwise permissible tinder this Agreement, the other Loan Instruments and
Applicable Law, subject, however, to the limitations imposed hereunder and
thereunder and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement.

          (b) Subject to the foregoing and the other terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments, the Administrative Agent in its
discretion from time to time may (but shall be under no duty or obligation to),
or at the written direction of the Majority Banks the Administrative Agent
shall, use reasonable efforts to effect the offer, sale, lease or other
disposition and delivery of the whole or any part of the Loan Collateral,
whether as a secured party in possession of


                                      -96-




<PAGE>



collateral or otherwise, and may otherwise exercise and enforce any and all
rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests afforded to it under this
Agreement, the other Loan Instruments and any and all provisions of Applicable
Law.

          (c) The Administrative Agent shall receive the proceeds or other
amounts realized from any judgment or other judicial award, any settlement (with
the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required), or any sale or other
disposition of any Loan Collateral and, after deducting all costs and expenses
incurred in connection therewith (including attorneys' disbursements, expenses
and fees), the Administrative Agent shall distribute the remainder in accordance
with Section 9.04 of this Agreement.

          Section 9.10. Reports and Information. Each Bank shall send to the
other Banks copies of any correspondence sent or received to or from the
Borrowers with respect to any Event of Default (other than items that would have
or appear to have been sent directly to the other Banks). At the request of the
Administrative Agent, each Bank promptly shall send to the Administrative Agent
copies of all notices of debiting any accounts and other correspondence
delivered by a Bank to any Borrower or any guarantor, surety or pledgor under
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument. Upon the specific request and at
the expense of a Bank, the Administrative Agent shall furnish to such Bank
copies of any report or other documents received by the Administrative Agent and
not separately delivered by the Borrowers to such Bank. Each Bank acknowledges
and agrees that: (a) any report or other information that the Administrative
Agent in its sole discretion elects to prepare will be prepared by the personnel
of the Administrative Agent from information made available by the Borrowers,
which personnel are not acting as auditors and who are not verifying the
information so supplied; (b) any report, document or other information provided
by the Administrative Agent to any Bank, whether in writing or orally, and
whether pursuant to this Article or otherwise, shall be without representation
or warranty by or any recourse whatsoever to the Administrative Agent with
respect to its authenticity, validity, accuracy, completeness, contents or
conformity to any requirements of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments;
and (c) all reports, documents and other information shall be provided and
received strictly on a confidential basis for the exclusive use of each Bank,
and no Bank shall make any such information available to any other person,
except (i) in connection with any assignment or participation permitted under
Section 10.14 hereof, (ii) for bank auditors and bank regulatory authorities,
(iii) the accountants, attorneys and other professionals of the disclosing Bank,
or (iv) as otherwise required by Applicable Law.

          Section 9.11. Bank's Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each
Bank hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the other Banks, solely for
their benefit, that such Bank: (a) has the power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform, and has duly authorized the execution, delivery and
performance, of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments to which it is a
party, and will not restrict or otherwise impair that power, authority or
authorization; (b) is a sophisticated and knowledgeable institution, both
generally and with respect to transactions of this type; (c) has received, (i)

the Borrowers relating to the Borrowers and each guarantor, surety or pledgor
(if any) as it deemed necessary or prudent, has had an opportunity to review and
evaluate, and in fact has independently reviewed and evaluated such documents
and information, and will continue to independently review and evaluate such of
the foregoing as it deems necessary or prudent, all in order to make its own
credit determination and other decisions; (d) has made, and will continue to
make that independent review, evaluation and credit determination and other
decisions under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments (i) without any
reliance upon any oral or written representation, warranty, advice or analysis
of any kind whatsoever from the Administrative Agent or any other person (other
than the Borrowers), however obtained, and (ii) without any regard to any
decision or adverse circumstance or change respecting any other banking, trust,
lending or other relationship that it may have with any Borrower or any of their
respective affiliates; (e) has made its loans and acquired its interests, and
will continue to make its loans and hold its interests, under this Agreement and
the other


                                      -97-

Loan Instruments for its own account; (f) has no present intent to, and will not
at any time in whole or in part, sell, convey, assign, transfer, further
participate or otherwise dispose of those loans or interests or any part
thereof, other than assignments and participations expressly permitted by
Section 10.13 hereof, and (g) has executed and delivered this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments to which it is a party, has made its loans, acquired its
interests and made its commitments and other agreements under this Agreement and
the other Loan Instruments, and will continue to hold those interests and
perform those commitments and agreements in accordance with all Applicable Laws,
including (without limitation) any legal lending limits applicable to it.

          Section 9.12. Credit Waivers and Exculpations. None of the
Administrative Agent and the other Banks has, and none of them shall be deemed
or construed to have, made any representation or warranty, offered any advice or
analysis, made any assumption of any liability or responsibility or made any
guaranty, whether orally or otherwise, and whether express or implied, to any
other Bank with respect to: (a) any recital, statement, representation or
warranty made by any Borrower, any of their respective Affiliates or any
guarantor, surety or pledgor under any Loan Instrument, any certificate
delivered by any officer of any such person(s), or any report, document or other
information delivered from time to time by any such person(s) or furnished on
their behalf; (b) the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan
Instrument; (c) the existing or future financial condition of any Borrower, any
of their respective Affiliates or any guarantor, surety or pledgor under any
Loan Instrument; (d) the existence or value of any Loan Collateral, or the
validity, sufficiency, priority or effectiveness of any Lien intended to be
created under or by any Loan Instrument; (e) the performance by any Borrower or
any of their respective Affiliates, or by any guarantor, surety or pledgor, of,
or the willingness, ability or likelihood of any of them to perform, their
respective obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument; or (f)
the validity, enforceability or collectibility of any of the Loan Obligations.

          Section 9.13. Reliance on Documents and Experts. The Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, statement, paper, document, writing or other communication (which may
be by telegram, cable, telex, telecopier or telephone) reasonably believed by it
to be genuine and to have been signed sent or made by the proper person or
persons, and upon opinions and advice of legal counsel (including counsel for
any Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent or any other Bank.

          Section 9.14. Status and Liability of the Administrative Agent, Etc.
The Administrative Agent shall be considered an independent contractor with
respect to the Banks, and no term or provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument is intended to create, nor shall any such term or provision be
deemed or construed to have created, any general common law agency, joint
venture, partnership or debtor-creditor relationship between or among the
Administrative Agent and the Banks or any investment contract or other security.
The Administrative Agent may exercise or otherwise enforce any of its rights,
powers, privileges, remedies and interests under this Agreement, the other Loan
Instruments and Applicable Law or perform any of its duties under this Agreement
and the other Loan Instruments by or through its directors, officers, employees,
attorneys, agents or designees. The Administrative Agent and its designees, and
their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, shall not
incur any liability (other than for a person's own acts or omissions breaching a
duty owed to the injured Bank and amounting to gross negligence or willful
misconduct as finally determined pursuant to Applicable Law by a governmental
Authority having jurisdiction) for acts and omissions arising out of or related
directly or indirectly to this Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Instrument,
any part of the Loan Collateral, any of the Loans or the application of any
proceeds thereof, or any Environmental Claim, and each Bank hereby expressly
waives any and all claims and actions (other than to the extent occasioned by a
person's own acts or omissions breaching a duty owed to the injured Bank and
amounting to gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined
pursuant to Applicable


                                      -98-




<PAGE>



Law by a governmental Authority having jurisdiction) against the Administrative
Agent or its designees, and their respective directors, officers, employees,
attorneys and agents, arising out of or related directly or indirectly to any
and all of the foregoing acts, omissions and circumstances.

          Section 9.15. Bank's Risk of Loss; Expenses; Indemnification.

          (a) Each Bank hereby acknowledges and agrees that it has assumed all
risk of loss to the extent of its Pro Rata Share of the Loans and all risk of
further expense and liability ratably in accordance with its Committed Share of
the Loans as of the date of the expense or the date on which the event giving
rise to the liability occurred, as the case may be.

          (b) The Banks shall use reasonable efforts to obtain prompt
reimbursement from the Borrowers, or from the proceeds of the Loan Collateral,
if any, realized in connection with any sale or other disposition, to the extent
such reimbursement is required by this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments,
for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in
connection with the preparation, execution and closing of this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments, all waivers, releases, discharges, satisfactions,
modifications and amendments thereof and consents with respect thereto, all
payments made and actions taken thereunder in the name or on behalf of any
Borrower, any of their respective affiliates or any guarantor, surety or pledgor
under any Loan Instrument, all periodic collateral audits and other evaluations
and any ongoing monitoring of the Accounts Receivable, Inventory and other Loan
Collateral (including, without limitation, the per diem fees and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and its designees in performing such audits and other
evaluations), all annual and other appraisals of the real estate included in the
Loan Collateral, and the administration, enforcement, protection and
adjudication of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments and the rights,
powers, privileges, remedies and other interests of the Banks thereunder and
under Applicable Law, and the acquisition, operation, development, improvement
or disposition of any Loan Collateral, including (without limitation) insurance
premiums, mortgage recording, documentary, transfer, intangible, note or other
similar taxes or revenue stamps, filing and recording expenses, and the
disbursements, expenses and reasonable fees of counsel to the Administrative
Agent and the other Banks, including Herrick, Feinstein LLP and the
disbursements, expenses and fees of any local or special counsel retained by any
of them. In the event such reimbursement is not obtained by the Administrative
Agent within a reasonable time after demand for such reimbursement from the
Borrowers, each Bank promptly upon demand shall pay to the Administrative Agent
a portion of such unreimbursed fees, costs and expenses proportional to its
Committed Share(s) of the Loans. The Banks, or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, promptly shall distribute to each Bank a reimbursement proportional
to such payments received from such Bank in respect of any such fee, cost and
expense subsequently reimbursed by the Borrowers.

          (c) To the extent not promptly reimbursed or otherwise indemnified by
the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and its designees, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, shall be indemnified,
reimbursed and held harmless by the Banks, and (at the request of the
Administrative Agent) defended at the expense of the Banks with counsel selected
by the Administrative Agent, promptly upon request and ratably in accordance
with their respective Committed Shares of the Loans as of the date of the event
giving rise to the claim occurred, from and against any and all claims,
liabilities, losses and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of them, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and agents, arising out of
or related directly or indirectly to this Agreement, any Note, any of the other
Loan Instruments, any part of the Loan Collateral, any part of the Loans or the
application of any proceeds thereof, or any Environmental Claim, except such as
are occasioned by the indemnified person's own acts or omissions breaching a
duty owed to a Bank and amounting to gross negligence or willful misconduct as
finally determined pursuant to Applicable Law by a governmental


                                      -99-




<PAGE>



Authority having jurisdiction; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be
deemed to relieve the Administrative Agent from bearing its Committed Share of
the Loans as a Bank of any of the foregoing liabilities.

          Section 9.16. Invalidation of Distributions. In the event any amount
paid or otherwise distributed to or received by any of the Banks in respect of
the Obligations or otherwise (a) must be returned or refunded to any Borrower by
the Administrative Agent or any other Bank pursuant this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument (including, without limitation, the return of any amount due to
miscalculation or other mistake or the return of any prepaid Letter of Credit
Fees upon the early termination of any Letter of Credit), or (b) is invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential or must otherwise be restored or
returned by the Administrative Agent or any other Bank upon the early
termination of any Letter of Credit) or upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any Borrower, any of their respective affiliates, any
guarantor, surety or pledgor under any other Loan Instrument, or any other
person, whether by order of any court, by any settlement approved by any court,
or otherwise, each Bank shall contribute back to the Administrative Agent an
amount such that each Bank will be affected by that invalidation, declaration,
restoration, refund, or return ratably in accordance with its Pro Rata Share(s)
of the relevant Loans as of the date of the subject payment, distribution or
receipt.

          Section 9.17. No Waiver of Rights, Independent Transactions, Etc.

          (a) With respect to its Pro Rata Share of the Loans the Administrative
Agent shall have the same rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests
under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments as the other Banks, and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent. Accordingly,
the terms "Bank" or "Banks" as used in this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument shall not be deemed to exclude any Bank because it is or may have
been the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          (b) Except as any term or provision of this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument may be breached thereby; each Bank also may accept deposits
from, lend money to (on a secured or unsecured basis) and generally engage in
any kind of banking, trust, lending or other business with any Borrower, any of
their respective Affiliates or any guarantor, surety or pledgor under any Loan
Instrument (each an "Independent Transaction"); and from time to time a Bank or
its affiliates may, accept and retain, without any obligation to report or
otherwise account to any other Bank, any and all payments and other amounts
received from or in respect of any such person(s) under any Independent
Transaction and any and all payments, distributions and proceeds received
respecting any collateral (other than Loan Collateral) securing or intending to
secure any of the obligations under any Independent Transaction. Any payment or
other amount received by the Administrative Agent from or to respect of any
Borrower, any of their respective Affiliates or any guarantor, surety or pledgor
under any Loan Instrument that is not designated or reasonably ascertainable
from the circumstances as being applicable to the Loan Obligations may be
arbitrarily applied by the Administrative Agent in its discretion to the Loan
Obligations or to any of the obligations of any such Person(s) under any
Independent Transaction with it. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any other
Bank shall be deemed by the execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument to have waived any right, power, privilege, remedy or interest under,
or other term or provision of, any Independent Transaction, except that to the
extent the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument by any party thereto may violate or constitute a default under
any term or provision of any Independent Transaction of any Bank, that violation
or default shall be deemed to have been permanently waived by such Bank's
execution of this Agreement.

          Section 9.18. Communications with the Borrowers. Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, no Bank shall give any
notice or waiver to or otherwise


                                      -100-




<PAGE>



communicate on behalf of all of the Banks directly with any Borrower, any of
their respective Affiliates, or any guarantor, surety or pledgor under any Loan
Instrument without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the
Majority Banks, as the case may be. A Bank may request that a particular demand,
notice, waiver or other communication be given to any such persons as required
or permitted pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument by giving
the Administrative Agent and the other Banks a signed notice of its request, or
by giving the Administrative Agent and the other Banks notice of its request
both by telephone and or telecopy of a signed notice and promptly confirming its
request by delivery to the Administrative Agent and each other Bank of an
original copy of the signed notice, which notice shall specify the desired
communication and contents and the reasons therefore. The Administrative Agent
in its discretion may, or at the request of the Majority Banks shall, give such
communication(s) to such person(s) (subject to the satisfaction of the
requirements of Section 9.06 hereof respecting certain waivers and other items);
provided however that if the Administrative Agent fails to give any such
communication(s) to any such person(s) within a reasonable period of time after
being so required by the requisite number of Banks, the Bank(s) so desiring such
communication(s) be given may give it directly to such person(s).

          Section 9.19. Delinquent Banks. Any Bank that fails to deliver funds
to or reimburse or otherwise indemnify the Administrative Agent or other
indemnified person as, when, and to the full extent required under this Article
shall be deemed delinquent under this Article until such time as that obligation
is satisfied in full (a Bank that is so delinquent will be referred to in this
Section as a "Delinquent Bank"). A Delinquent Bank shall be deemed to have
assigned any and all payments thereafter due to it in respect of the Loan
Obligations, whether on account of principal, Interest, fees or otherwise as
well as the proceeds of all Loan Collateral, to the nondelinquent Banks, and the
Delinquent Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute those
assigned amounts to the nondelinquent Banks in proportion to their respective
Pro Rata Shares, except that amounts assigned on account of a Delinquent Bank's
failure to reimburse or otherwise indemnify may instead, in the discretion of
the Administrative Agent, be allocated and distributed to the nondelinquent
Banks or directly to any other indemnified person in such amounts as the
Administrative Agent deems appropriate to reflect the respective assumptions of
liability of the Banks under this Article. A Delinquent Bank shall be deemed to
have satisfied in full any such delinquency when and if, as a result of the
distribution of the assigned amounts, the Banks' respective Pro Rata Shares
shall have returned to those in effect immediately prior to the delinquency, and
refunds and direct payments respecting reimbursements and indemnification shall
have been made in an amount equal to that not paid by the Delinquent Bank with
respect thereto. This assignment and authorization shall be deemed to be a power
coupled with an interest, shall be absolute and irrevocable and shall be
effective during any period of delinquency. A Delinquent Bank's approval shall
not be required for any reason whatsoever under this Agreement, any other Loan
Instrument or Applicable Law, including (without limitation) any required or
permitted approval, consent or vote, and any requirement for joint action,
unanimity or majority or other approval may be satisfied by the nondelinquent
Banks with their respective Pro Rata Shares recomputed by excluding the Pro Rata
Share of each Delinquent Bank. A Delinquent Bank may not make any assignment or
sell any participation pursuant to Section 10.13 hereof.

          Section 9.20. No Third Party Rights. The representations, warranties
and other terms and provisions of Sections 9.02 to 9.20 of this Article are for
the exclusive benefit of the Banks. Accordingly, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, no Borrower, Affiliate, other guarantor, surety or pledgor, or
other person shall be entitled to rely upon, or to raise as a defense, the
failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Bank to comply with those terms
and provisions, shall have any right or claim against the Administrative Agent
or any other Bank by reason of any of those terms and provisions or shall be
entitled to enforce any of those terms and provisions against the Administrative
Agent or any other Bank.

          Section 9.21. Resignation and Successor Administrative Agent.

          (a) The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Banks and the Borrowers. Upon such resignation, the Majority Banks
shall have the right to designate a successor Administrative Agent with the
consent of the Borrowers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). In the event no one has been approved (or accepted the appointment) as
successor Administrative Agent within thirty days of the Administrative Agent's
notice of resignation, the Administrative Agent in its discretion may (on behalf
of all of the Banks) appoint an Eligible Assignee (but only if organized under
the laws of the United States or any state thereof) as successor Administrative
Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder,
the successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all of the rights, powers, privileges, interest and duties of the resigning
Administrative Agent, and the resigning Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations as "Administrative Agent" under this Agreement
and the other Loan Instruments. After resigning as Administrative Agent, the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments shall
nevertheless inure to the resigned Administrative Agent's benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted while it was Administrative Agent.

          (b) If the successor Administrative Agent is not otherwise a Bank at
the time it accepts appointment as successor Administrative Agent under this
Agreement, then contemporaneously with such appointment the successor
Administrative Agent shall purchase from the other Banks an aggregate interest
in the Loans equal to a Committed Share and Pro Rata Share of not less than
$5,000,000. Each Bank shall be obligated to sell a pro rata portion of such
Loans to the successor Administrative Agent (although two or more Banks by
mutual agreement may redistribute among themselves their collective pro rata
obligation). The successor Administrative Agent shall pay to each selling Bank
an acquisition price equal to the applicable percentage of the seller's Pro Rata
Share of (i) the principal balance of the Loans then outstanding under this
Agreement and other Loan Instruments and (ii) all shared interest, fees and
other amounts accrued but unpaid through the closing of the acquisition. A Bank
shall not be relieved of its pro rata obligation hereunder by virtue of having
sold all or any portion of its interest to one or more participants. The
purchase and sale required hereby shall be effected by an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement in the form of Exhibit G hereto.

          Section 9.22. Delegation of Duties by Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent from time to time may delegate in whole or in part any one
or more of its rights, powers, privileges, remedies and duties under this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments to another Bank, with its consent,
which delegation may be general or specific and may be subject to such
conditions and limitations as may be specified, and which delegation may be
terminated at any time by the Administrative Agent. Any such delegation or
termination shall be effective upon written notice from the Administrative Agent
to the parties hereto. Any Bank to whom such a delegation has been made may
elect at any time to terminate that delegation by written notice to the parties
hereto, effective upon their receipt of that notice. Any Bank to whom such a
delegation has been made shall be deemed to be the "Administrative Agent"
hereunder, and individually may exercise the Administrative Agent's rights,
powers, privileges and remedies and shall perform its duties tinder this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments to the extent and for the duration of
that delegation with the same binding effect as exercise or performance by the
delegating Administrative Agent.

          Section 9.23. Syndication Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree that the
Syndication Agent shall not have any rights, duties or responsibilities in its
capacity as Syndication Agent hereunder and that the Syndication Agent shall not
have the authority to take any action hereunder in its capacity as such.

Instrument, a manually signed original must be delivered by the party giving it;
any other notice, request, demand or other communication instead may be sent by
telecopy, with the cost of transmission prepaid or for the account of the
sender, and shall (except as otherwise specified in this Agreement or any other
Loan Instrument) be deemed conclusively to have been given on the first Business

prepaid to such persons, but any failure or delay in sending such copies shall
not affect the validity of any such notice, request, demand or other
communication so given to a party.

          Section 10.02. Expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Banks. The
Borrowers shall pay or reimburse on demand any and all costs and expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent, whether directly or indirectly, in
connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the commitment, the
preparation, execution and closing of this Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments, all waivers, releases, discharges, satisfactions, modifications and

recording expenses and charges, and the disbursements, expenses and reasonable
fees of counsel to the Administrative Agent or any other Bank, including
Herrick, Feinstein LLP, and the disbursements, expenses and reasonable fees of
any local or special counsel retained by any of them.

          Section 10.03. Further Assurances. Each Borrower agrees to do such
further acts and things and to execute and deliver such statements, assignments,
agreements, instruments and other documents as the Majority Banks or the
Administrative Agent from time to time reasonably may request in connection with
the administration, maintenance, enforcement or adjudication of this Agreement
and the other Loan Instruments in order (a) to evidence, confirm, perfect or
protect any security interest or other Lien granted or required to have been
granted under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments,

(b) to give the Administrative Agent, the Banks or their respective designees
confirmation and assurance of their rights, powers, privileges, remedies and
interests under this Agreement, the other Loan Instruments and Applicable Law,
(c) to better enable the Administrative Agent, the Banks or their respective
designees to exercise any such privilege or remedy, or (d) to otherwise
effectuate the purpose and the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments, each in such form and substance as may be acceptable to
the Administrative Agent and the Majority Banks.

          Section 10.04. Reliance, Exculpation and Indemnification.

          (a) The Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks shall be
entitled to rely upon any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, statement,
paper, document, writing or other communication (which to the extent permitted
hereunder may be by telecopy or telephone) reasonably believed by such Bank to
be genuine and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper person or
persons, and upon opinions and advice of legal counsel (including counsel for
any Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by the
Administrative Agent. Each Bank shall be entitled to rely, and in entering into
this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments in fact has relied, upon the
representations, warranties and other information respecting each Borrower
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments notwithstanding any
investigation, analysis or evaluation that may have been made or from time to
time may be made by any Bank or its designees of all or any part of the assets,
business, operations, properties or condition (financial or otherwise) of any
Borrower or any other person.

          (b) The Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks and their
respective participants and designees, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys and agents, shall not incur any liability (other than to
the extent occasioned by a person's own acts or omissions breaching a duty owed
to the Borrowers and amounting to gross negligence or willful misconduct as
finally determined pursuant to Applicable Law by a governmental Authority having
jurisdiction) for acts and omissions arising out of or related directly or
indirectly to this Agreement, any other Loan Instrument, any part of Collateral,
any of the Loans or the application of any proceeds thereof, or any
Environmental Claim; and each Borrower hereby expressly waives any and all
claims and actions (other than to the extent occasioned by a person's own acts
or omissions breaching a duty owed to the Borrowers and amounting to gross
negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined pursuant to Applicable
Law by a governmental Authority having jurisdiction) against the Administrative
Agent and each of the other Banks and their respective participants and
designees, and their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and
agents, arising out of or related directly or indirectly to any and all of the
foregoing acts, omissions and circumstances.

          (c) The Administrative Agent and each of the other Banks and their
respective participants and designees, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys and agents, each shall be indemnified, reimbursed and held
harmless by the Borrowers, and (at the request of such Bank) defended at the
expense of the Borrowers with counsel selected by such Bank, from and against
any and all claims, liabilities, losses and expenses (including, without
limitation, the disbursements, expenses and reasonable fees of their respective
attorneys) that may be imposed upon, incurred by, or asserted against any of
them, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and
agents, arising out of or related directly or indirectly to this Agreement, any
other Loan Instrument, any part of Collateral, any of the Loans or the

                                      -106-




<PAGE>



pursued or exhausted for any or no reason whatsoever, or any such right, power,
privilege, remedy or interest may be waived, omitted or otherwise not exercised
or enforced (whether intentionally or otherwise), all in such manner and order,
upon such terms and provisions and subject to such conditions as the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if
required) or any other Bank may deem necessary or desirable in its or their sole
and absolute discretion, all without notice to or further assent from any
Borrower except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, and all
without affecting this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments or any of the
obligations hereunder or thereunder. As between the Administrative Agent and the
Banks however, the preceding provisions are not intended to and shall not be
deemed or construed as modifying the relative rights and obligations of the
Administrative Agent and the Banks under this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument.

          Section 10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument may be executed in two or more counterpart copies of the entire
document or of signature pages to the document each of which may be executed by

hereto or thereto (as the case may be).

          Section 10.12. Effective Date. This Agreement shall be effective on
the date (the "Effective Date") as of which (a) this Agreement shall be executed
by all the parties hereto and delivered to the Administrative Agent and (b) all
the conditions precedent required to have been satisfied on or before the
Effective Date pursuant to Article IV hereof shall have been satisfied or waived
(whether temporarily or otherwise) in writing by the Administrative Agent (with
the consent of the Requisite Banks as and if required). The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrowers of the Effective Date if other than the date of the
closing of this Agreement, provided, however, that the failure to give such
notice shall not alter the Effective Date.

          Section 10.13. Successors and Assigns; Assignment.

          (a) Whenever in this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument reference
is made to any party, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors,
assigns, heirs and legal representatives of such party, and, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, all representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements made by or on behalf of each Borrower in this Agreement and the
other Loan Instruments shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns
of the Banks; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be deemed to
authorize or permit any Borrower to assign any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument to any other person (whether
or not an affiliate of such Borrower), and each Borrower covenants and agrees
that it shall not make any such assignment. Any Bank from time to time: (a) may
assign all or any portion(s) of the rights, powers, privileges, remedies and
interests of, and/or the Loans and other Obligations owed to such Bank under,
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument (i) to any Affiliate of such Bank,
or in the manner provided in subparagraph (b) below, (b) may sell a
participation interest in all or any portion(s) of the rights, powers,
privileges, remedies and interests of, and/or the Loans and other Obligations
owed to such Bank under, this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument to any
Affiliate of such Bank, or in the manner provided in subparagraph (e) below, (c)
may furnish and disclose financial statements, documents and other information
pertaining to any Borrower or any Surety or to any potential assignee or
participant permitted hereunder and (d) may take any and all other actions that
such Bank may determine (in its sole and absolute discretion) to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with any such assignment, or participation; in each
case, unless otherwise required below, without notice to or consent of any
Borrower or any other Person.

          (b) Any Bank may assign (each such assigning Bank is referred to
herein as an "Assignor") to one or more Eligible Assignee (each an "Assignee")
all or a portion of its rights and


                                      -107-




<PAGE>



obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments (including all
or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it), provided
that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an Affiliate, each of
Aeroflex, the Fronting Bank and the Administrative Agent must give its prior
written consent to such assignment, (ii) the amount subject to such assignment
shall satisfy the provisions of subsection 10.13(c), (iii) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment
and Assumption Agreement (an "Assignment Agreement") in the form of Exhibit G
hereto together with, unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (iv) the Assignee, if it shall not
be a Bank, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative
questionnaire in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
and provided further, that any consent of Aeroflex otherwise required under this
paragraph shall not be required if a Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
Administrative Agent and the execution and delivery of any tax forms required by
subsection (d) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment Agreement, the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment Agreement, have the
rights and obligations of a Bank under the Loan Instruments, and the Assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
Agreement, be released from its obligations under the Loan Instruments,
including (without limitation) the assigned portion of the Commitment (and, in
the case of an Assignment Agreement covering all of the Assignor's rights and
obligations under the Loan Instruments, such Bank shall cease to be a party
hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.04, 2.09
and 10.02). Any assignment or transfer by a Bank of rights or obligations under
the Loan Instruments that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated
for purposes of the Loan Instruments as a sale by such Bank of a participation
in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.
Notwithstanding any such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall retain and
exercise various administrative functions and continue to hold the various
security interests granted under this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments
in the manner and to the extent contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Loan Instruments. Each Borrower agrees to execute and deliver such amendments to
or restatements of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments as may be
reasonably required to reflect any such assignment. The Assignor shall give a
copy of any Assignment Agreement to the Borrowers, provided that any failure or
delay in giving any such copy shall not affect the validity of any such
assignment.

          (c) Except for an assignment required to be effected under Section
9.21 hereof, no assignment described in subsection (b) of this Section shall be
effected: (i) for a Committed Share and Pro Rata Share of less than $5,000,000,
unless constituting the entire then remaining interest of the Assignor; or (ii)
if the Assignor is a Delinquent Bank.

          (d) Any Eligible Assignee (other than one organized under the laws of
the United States or any state thereof) that is exempt from United States
federal withholding tax or subject to a reduced rate by treaty shall, on or
before the date it becomes a Bank hereunder, complete, execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers (one original to each) Internal
Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, as applicable, and Form W-8 or W-9, as
applicable, or any successor form, and such other forms), certificate(s) and
document(s) as may be required under the Code to establish such Eligible
Assignee's entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate. If any such Eligible
Assignee is not entitled to any such exemption or reduced rate, the Bank
proposing to assign to such Eligible Assignee shall give the Administrative
Agent and the Borrowers notice of that determination promptly but in any event
not less than three Business Days prior to the date it executes and delivers its
Assignment Agreement. Any such Eligible Assignee that becomes a Bank shall, from
time to time, complete, execute and deliver such updates or extensions to or
renewals or replacements of those forms, certificates and documents as may be
necessary to reflect any change in circumstance or Applicable Law or to continue
any such exemption or reduced rate.

          (e) Subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, each Bank
and its participants (other than a Delinquent Bank) shall have the unrestricted
right at any time and from time to time to grant to one or more banks or other
financial institutions a participation interest in all or an undivided portion
of its rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests under this Agreement
and the other Loan Instruments, in any case without any notice to or consent of
any Borrower; provided that the selling Bank shall give the Administrative Agent
written notice of each such sale, specifying the purchaser and share purchased;
and provided further that no Bank shall permit its direct or indirect
participant to further assign or participate its interests hereunder without
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent. However, the sale or other
transfer of a participation shall not reduce, shift or otherwise affect any of
the agreements, duties, obligations or liabilities of the selling Bank under
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument, which shall continue in full force
and effect and remain the sole responsibility of the selling Bank, and each such
selling Bank agrees that it will not raise (and hereby expressly waives) any
defense relating to any such participation. Furthermore, no Bank shall grant to
any participant the right to approve any supplement to, modification, amendment,
restatement or waiver of, or departure from this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument other than with respect to (i) any reduction in the principal of the
Loans or in the calculation of interest thereon (other than default interest),
or any postponement of any date fixed for any payment of principal or interest
on the Loans (other than default interest), to the extent the participant has an
interest in such Loans, or (ii) the release of all or substantially all of the
Loan Collateral other than as contemplated by the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and other Loan Instruments. The Administrative Agent and other Banks
and parties may continue to deal directly and exclusively with any such selling
Bank.

          (f) Each Bank and its participants from time to time may furnish and
disclose financial statements, documents and other information pertaining to the
Borrowers to any potential assignee or participant. Each Borrower covenants and
agrees to furnish copies of financial statements, reports and other documents
required under this Agreement directly to such potential assignees and
participants as any Bank from time to time may, request.

          (g) Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any Bank's source of
funds may derive in part from its participants. Accordingly, references in
Sections 1.01 and 2.04 and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Instruments to rates, determinations, reserve and capital
adequacy requirements, expenses, increased costs, reduced receipts and the like
as they pertain to any Bank shall be deemed also to include those of each of its
participants (subject, in each case, to the maximum amount that would have been
incurred by or attributable to such Bank directly if such Bank, rather than the
participant, had held the interest participated).

          (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan
Instrument, any Bank may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights
under the Loan Instruments including any portion of any Note held by it to any
of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the
Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341; provided, that, no such pledge or
enforcement thereof shall release such Bank from its obligations under any of
the Loan Instruments.

          Section 10.14. Limits on the Administrative Agent's Ability to Act,
Etc. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument to
the contrary, each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Article IX hereof and
other terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments
generally limit the authority of the Administrative Agent to act without the
consent of certain or all of the other Banks. Each Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation under this
Agreement any other Loan Instrument or Applicable Law to act in disregard or
contravention of those terms and provisions.

          Section 10.15. No Third Party Rights. The representations, warranties
and other terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments
are for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or therein, no other person, including creditors of
any party hereto, shall have any right or claim against any party by reason of
any of those terms and provisions or be entitled to enforce any of those terms
and provisions against any party.

          Section 10.16. No Waiver by Action, Etc. Any waiver or consent
respecting any representation, warranty, covenant or other term or provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not be
deemed, regardless of frequency given, to be a further or continuing waiver or
consent. The failure or delay of a party at any time or times to require
performance of, or to exercise its rights with respect to, any representation,
warranty, covenant or other term or provision of this Agreement or other Loan
Instrument in no manner (except as otherwise expressly provided herein) shall
affect its right at a later time to enforce any such provision. No notice to or
demand on any Borrower in any case shall entitle such party to any other or
further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. The
acceptance by the Administrative Agent or any other Bank of (a) any partial or
late payment shall not constitute a satisfaction or waiver of the full amount
then due or the resulting Event of Default or (b) any payment during the
continuance of an Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver or cure
thereof; and the Administrative Agent or any other Bank may accept or reject any
such payment without affecting any of its rights, powers, privileges, remedies
and other interests under this Agreement, the other Loan Instruments and
Applicable Law. All rights, powers, privileges, remedies and other interests of
the Administrative Agent or any other Bank hereunder are cumulative and not
alternatives, and they are in addition to and shall not limit (except as
otherwise expressly provided herein) any other right, power, privilege, remedy
or other interest of the Administrative Agent or any other Bank under this
Agreement, any other Loan Instrument or Applicable Law.

          Section 10.17. Modification, Amendment, Etc. Except to the extent that
the approval or signatures of all of the Banks is not required as provided below
or in any other term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument, each and every supplement or amendment to or modification or
restatement of this Agreement or any other Loan Instrument shall be in writing
and signed by the parties hereto or thereto, respectively, and each and every
waiver of, or consent to any departure from, any representation, warranty,
covenant or other term or provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Instrument shall be in writing and signed by the affected parties hereto or
thereto, respectively; provided, however, that (a) the Administrative Agent
(with the consent of the Requisite Banks, as and if required) may sign all
waivers and consents on behalf of all of the Banks, and (b) the Requisite Banks
may approve and sign (or authorize the Administrative Agent to sign) on behalf
of all of the Banks certain waivers, supplements, modifications, amendments and
restatements of this Agreement and the other Loan Instruments in accordance with
Article IX hereof and the other applicable terms and provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Instruments.

          Section 10.18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan
Instruments are intended by the parties as the final, complete and exclusive
statement of the transactions evidenced thereby. All prior or contemporaneous
promises, agreements and understandings, whether oral or written, are deemed to
be superceded by this Agreement and such other Loan Instruments, and no party is
relying on any promise, agreement or understanding not set forth in this
Agreement or such other Loan Instruments.
