<P>Dear Mr. Rielly:<BR>

<P>This letter will confirm our understanding concerning your
participation in the Amerada Hess Corporation Pension Restoration
Plan (the &#147;PRP&#148;) and the deferred compensation you will
receive in connection with your employment by Amerada Hess
Corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) as Vice President and
Controller on April&nbsp;2, 2001.

<P>The Compensation Committee of the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors
has determined that you will receive Prior Service (as defined in
Section&nbsp;4.1 of the PRP) for 16&nbsp;1/2 years of related
experience with Ernst&nbsp;&#38; Young LLP (&#147;E&#38;Y&#148;)
acquired prior to the date of your employment by the Corporation for
the purpose of determining PRP benefits, provided, however, that the
service requirements for vesting and early retirement under the PRP
shall be based on actual service with the Corporation.

<P>In general, PRP benefits are calculated as a life annuity based on
the formula of the Corporation&#146;s Employees&#146; Pension Plan
(the &#147;Pension Plan&#148;) as though your Prior Service counted
under that plan, and there were no legal limits on qualified plan
benefits or annual compensation. The resulting amount is reduced as
necessary to account for any payment before age 65 or in any form
other than a life annuity based on the actuarial factors used to
determine Pension Plan benefits. Then the amount is reduced by
subtracting any benefits payable from the Pension Plan. Finally, the
PRP amount is reduced by:

to or on behalf of the Member under the qualified and nonqualified
pension plans of any prior employers derived from periods of
employment with such employers for which credit for Prior Service was
granted, or such amounts as would be payable from investments made
with the proceeds of lump sum payments received by the Member from
such other plans in a manner determined by the Committee at the time
credit for such Prior Service is
granted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#148;</TD>

<P>You have advised us that the only pension you are entitled to
receive as a result of your employment with E&#38;Y is a monthly
benefit from the general employee plan, which is
