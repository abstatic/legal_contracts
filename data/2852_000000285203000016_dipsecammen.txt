                  for any Letter of Credit Obligations pursuant to the

                  each Borrower will pay to Agent for the ratable benefit of
                  itself and Revolving Lenders cash or cash equivalents
                  acceptable to Agent ("Cash Equivalents") in an amount

                  drawn under each applicable Letter of Credit outstanding
                  for the benefit of such Borrower. Such funds or Cash
                  Equivalents shall be held by Agent in a cash collateral
                  account (the "Cash Collateral Account") maintained at a
                                -----------------------
                  bank or financial institution acceptable to Agent. The Cash

<PAGE>

                  of, Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, in a
                  manner satisfactory to Agent. Each Borrower hereby
                  pledges and grants to Agent, on behalf of itself and
                  Lenders, a security interest in all such funds and Cash
                  Equivalents held in the Cash Collateral Account from time
                  to time and all proceeds thereof, as security for the payment
                  of all amounts due in respect of the Letter of Credit
                  Obligations and other Obligations, whether or not then due.
                  The Agreement, including this Annex B, shall constitute a
                                                -------
                  security agreement under applicable law."
