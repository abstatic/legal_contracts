number of such meetings held by the Board and Board Committees (excluding
the Executive Committee) on which the director served during fiscal year
2002 (or shorter period that the director served). The reduction shall
be applied to offset the amount of the retainer payable in the following
forms: first, to reduce any cash payment; second, to reduce any credit
of Elective Deferrals as defined in the Plan to the Plan&#146;s Interest
Account; and last, to reduce any credit of Elective Deferrals to the
