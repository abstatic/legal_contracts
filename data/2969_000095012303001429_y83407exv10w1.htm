Air Products Stock Account for retainer and meeting fees, and
(ii)&nbsp;on the effective date specified in the Program for
crediting Directors with initial and annual deferred stock unit
awards. For purposes of the Plan, Fair Market Value of a share
of common stock on any date (the &#147;valuation date&#148;) shall be
equal to the mean of the high and low sale prices on the New
York Stock Exchange, as reported on the composite transaction
tape, for such date, or, if no sales were quoted on such date,
on the most recent preceding date on which sales were quoted.
The units thus calculated are herein referred to as &#147;deferred
stock units.&#148;</FONT></TD>
