        to pay rent). Tenant shall not be entitled to any

        Tenant shall default in the performance of any of its
        obligations under this Lease, Landlord may (but shall not
        be obligated to) apply all or any portion of the Security
        Deposit to the damages sustained by Landlord as a result
        of or to cure such default. Landlord's application of the
        Security Deposit pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
        not be construed as an agreement to limit the amount of
        Landlord's claim or as a waiver of any damage resulting
        from Tenant's default. At any time that Landlord shall
        have applied all or a portion of the Security Deposit as
        aforesaid, Tenant shall, within ten (1 0) days after a
        request by Landlord, pay Landlord a sum equal to the
        portion of the Security Deposit so applied, which sum
        shall then become part of the Security Deposit. The
