essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change of control may exist and that the uncertainty
and questions, which such possibility may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, it is imperative to be able to rely upon
management&#146;s continuance and that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company&#146;s management, including you, to their assigned duties without distraction in
the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change of control of the Company. </FONT></P><P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P><P

to any other form or report to the Securities and Exchange Commission or any stock exchange on which the Company&#146;s shares are listed which requires the reporting of a change of control. In addition, a Change of Control shall be deemed to have
occurred if (i) any &#147;person&#148; (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 20% of the combined voting
power of the Company&#146;s then outstanding securities; or (ii) in any two year period, individuals who were members of the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) at the beginning of such period plus each new director whose election or
nomination for election was approved by at least two-thirds of the directors in office immediately prior to such election or nomination, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, or (iii) a majority of the members of the
Board in office prior to the happening of any event and who are still in office after such event, determines in its sole discretion within one year after such event, that as a result of such event there has been a Change of Control. </FONT></P>
