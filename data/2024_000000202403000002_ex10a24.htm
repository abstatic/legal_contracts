<br>
<BR>
<U><B>RECITALS<BR>
<BR>
     </B></U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Seller is the owner of that certain real property located in the County of Placer, State of California, consisting of certain improvements and land as more specifically described below (and defined below as the &quot;Property&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the date hereof, Seller leases portions of the Property to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, to Hewlett-Packard Company and to Buyer on long term leases, and to other tenants on month-to-month or short term leases (collectively, and as further described below, the &quot;Existing Leases&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seller and Buyer acknowledge that:  (i)&nbsp;Seller and Buyer desire to execute a long-term ground lease (the &quot;Lease&quot;) as of the Preliminary Closing (as defined below); (ii) as a concession to Buyer, Seller agreed to grant to Buyer an option to purchase the Property provided that Buyer will cooperate with Seller in consummating an exchange since Seller does not desire to convert Seller's investment to cash but rather desires to maintain its investment in real property; (iii) Buyer desires to develop the Property for use as a distribution center for its products and such other uses as Buyer may desire; (iv) Buyer desires to commence construction of additional buildings and related improvements on the Property by February 15, 2003; and (v)&nbsp;in order to accommodate Buyer's desire to acquire the Property and commence construction while simultaneously allowing Seller to complete an exchange, Seller and Buyer agreed that, if Buyer exercises the Option (as defined below), the Close of Escrow (as defined below) will occur on September&nbsp;10, 2003 after written notice by Buyer to Seller given anytime after July&nbsp;31, 2003 and on or before August&nbsp;29, 2003.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, Seller and Buyer agree as follows:<BR>
<U><B><BR>
<BR>
AGREEMENT<BR>
<BR>
ARTICLE 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPTION; COVENANTS DURING OPTION PERIOD; PRELIMINARY CLOSING
</B></U><b><BR>
</b>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Grant of Option</U>.
Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer an exclusive option to purchase the Property (&quot;Option&quot;).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Term of Option</U>.
The term of the Option shall commence on the date of this Agreement (as set forth in the introductory paragraph hereof), and shall expire at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on August&nbsp;29, 2003 (&quot;Option Termination Date&quot;), unless previously exercised or cancelled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Exercise of Option; Sale of Property</U>.  Except as provided in Section 1.5, if Buyer elects to exercise the Option, Buyer shall do so by delivering written notice (&quot;Exercise Notice&quot;) to Seller and to Escrow Holder (as defined below) of its election to so exercise at any time from and after July 1, 2003 and on or before August&nbsp;29, 2003 (the &quot;Option Exercise Period&quot;).  Upon exercise of the Option by Buyer, Seller shall sell and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Property on the terms and conditions contained herein.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Failure to Exercise Option</U>.  If, after closing pursuant to the Preliminary Closing, Buyer fails to exercise the Option prior to expiration of the Option Exercise Period, the Option shall automatically terminate and the provisions of Section 18.2 below shall apply.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Deposit with Escrow</U>.  The terms and conditions of the Option granted hereunder and Seller's sale of the Property to Buyer, and the instructions to Escrow Holder with regard to the escrow (the &quot;Escrow&quot;) created pursuant hereto are as set forth in this Agreement.  Within five (5) business days of the execution of this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall deliver a fully executed original counterpart of this Agreement and a fully executed and notarized original of the Memorandum of Option (as defined below) to Escrow Holder.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Restrictions on Transfer by Seller</U>.  During the term of the Option (and if exercised, until the Close of Escrow), in no event shall Seller directly or indirectly, voluntarily or by operation of law, sell, exchange, convey, transfer, contract to sell, dispose of, or further encumber the Property or any part thereof or any interest therein, or be divested of title to the Property or any part thereof or interest therein (individually or collectively, as the context may require, a &quot;sale&quot;) without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may be given or withheld in Buyer's sole discretion.  For purposes of this Section, the term &quot;sale&quot; shall include, without limitation, if Seller or a general partner or a member of Seller is a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or closely-held corporation, the issuance, sale, conveyance, transfer, disposition or encumbering of more than fifty percent (50%) of any class of the currently issued and outstanding capital stock of Seller or of a general partner or member of Seller or of the beneficial interest of such partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or trust, or a change of any general partner or any member or any joint
venture, either voluntarily, involuntarily or otherwise.  For purposes of this Section, the term &quot;closely-held corporation&quot; shall mean any corporation not listed on any of the New York, American or Pacific stock exchanges.  The transfer by any partner or member of Seller or by any direct or indirect interest holder in any partner or member of Seller, to the extent the transfer consists solely of an inter vivos gift or testamentary transfer to any spouse, parent, sibling, in-law, child or grandchild of such partner, member or interest holder, or to a trust for the benefit of such partner, member or interest holder, or such spouse, parent, sibling, in-law, child or grandchild of such partner, member or interest holder, shall not be deemed a &quot;sale&quot; for purposes of this Section.  At Buyer's option, any sale of the Property or any part thereof in violation of this Section shall be deemed null and void.  The restrictions set forth in this Section shall survive the exercise by Buyer of the Option and shall continue to the Close of Escrow, but shall terminate if Buyer does not timely exercise the Option.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Existing Loan</U>.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><U>Loan</U>.  Seller informs Buyer that as of the date of this Agreement, the Property is encumbered by a Deed of Trust (the &quot;Deed of Trust&quot;) dated August&nbsp;19, 2001 executed by Seller for the benefit of Western Sierra National Bank (&quot;Lender&quot;), recorded as Document&nbsp;No.&nbsp;2002-0100927 in the Official Records of Placer County, California and securing certain financing by Lender to Seller in the original principal amount of Twelve Million Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($12,780,000) (the &quot;Loan&quot;).

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Credit Against Purchase Price</U>.  In addition to any other rights or remedies Buyer may have at law, in equity or pursuant to any other agreement (including, the Nondisturbance Agreement (as defined below)), any sums paid by Buyer to Lender to cure any default under the Loan may, at Buyer's election, be credited against the Purchase Price at the Close of Escrow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Non-Disturbance</U>.  As a condition for the benefit of Buyer which must be satisfied during the Contingency Period (as defined below), Lender, Seller and Buyer shall execute and acknowledge a separate nondisturbance agreement (&quot;Nondisturbance Agreement&quot;) for the benefit of Buyer, in such form and containing such provisions as reasonably acceptable to Buyer, including a provision that provides if the interest of Seller in the Property is transferred by reason of any foreclosure of the Deed of Trust or by deed in lieu or in aid thereof, Lender or any such transferee of the Property shall be bound to Buyer, and Buyer  shall be bound to Lender or such transferee, under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement and the Lease for the balance of the term of this Agreement and the term of the Lease, respectively, with the same force and effect as if Lender or such transferee were the original seller under this Agreement and the original lessor under the Lease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Use of Option Consideration to Cure Loan Default</U>.  Buyer may, at its sole option, elect to use all or any part of the Option Consideration from time to time to cure any default under the Loan which it is entitled to cure pursuant to the Nondisturbance Agreement, upon presentation by Buyer to Escrow Holder of a copy of the notice of such default sent by Lender and a certificate executed by Buyer stating its intent to use the amount stated in such certificate to cure the default, provided that Buyer may use the Option Consideration only to the extent reasonably necessary to cure the default then existing under the Loan.  Buyer shall have no obligation to restore any amounts of the Option Consideration so used to Escrow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT COLOR="#000000"><U>Restrictions During Option Period</U>.  During the term of this Option, and continuing until the Close of Escrow if the Option is exercised by Buyer, Seller shall not intentionally take any action with respect to the Property that interferes with or in any way affects the permitting, development or construction by Buyer of improvements on the Property.<BR>
<BR>

(x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Title Company shall have irrevocably committed to issue its leasehold policy of title insurance (the &quot;Leasehold Policy&quot;) ensuring Buyer's leasehold interest under the Lease and option rights under this Agreement.

18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U>Termination Prior to Expiration of Contingency Period</U>.  If Buyer fails to effectuate the Preliminary Closing for any reason, then this Agreement shall be terminated and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further rights or duties hereunder except for the following which are herein referred to as the &quot;Continuing Duties&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer's indemnity obligations under Section 17;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer shall return all Documents and Materials received and other things received from Seller;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seller and Buyer shall execute and record, if necessary, any and all documents reasonably required to terminate the Option;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seller and Title Company shall return to Buyer any monies deposited by Buyer; and<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Liquidated Damages</U>.  IF, AFTER BUYER'S EXERCISE OF THE OPTION, BUYER COMMITS A MATERIAL DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CLOSE OF ESCROW FAILS TO OCCUR BY REASON OF SUCH DEFAULT, THEN IN ANY SUCH EVENT, ESCROW HOLDER MAY BE INSTRUCTED BY SELLER TO CANCEL THE ESCROW, AND SELLER SHALL THEREUPON BE RELEASED FROM ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER.  BASED UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW EXISTING, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH SELLER'S DAMAGES BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT.  ACCORDINGLY, IN ADDITION TO SELLER'S RIGHT TO THE OPTION CONSIDERATION PURSUANT TO SECTION&nbsp;1.9(iii) ABOVE, SELLER SHALL RETAIN THE OPTION CONSIDERATION AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER ITEMS DEFINED IN THIS SECTION 18.2.  IF THE ESCROW AND THIS AGREEMENT ARE TERMINATED AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE LEASE AND THE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AND BUYER SHALL STILL BE OBLIGATED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AND THE DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  SELLER AND BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPLICABLE FOREGOING AMOUNT OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IS REASONABLE AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND SHALL BE SELLER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER RELIEF, RIGHT OR REMEDY, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, TO WHICH SELLER MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED BY REASON OF BUYER'S DEFAULT.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PROVISIONS OF SECTIONS 18.1(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (WITH RESPECT TO ANY FUNDS OF BUYER HELD BY ESCROW HOLDER IN EXCESS OF THE OPTION CONSIDERATION) AND (v) SHALL APPLY.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH, SELLER WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS WHICH SELLER OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE HAD UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 3389 TO SPECIFICALLY ENFORCE THIS AGREEMENT.  SELLER AND BUYER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 18.2 AND BY THEIR INITIALS IMMEDIATELY BELOW AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.<BR>
