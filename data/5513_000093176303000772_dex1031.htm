full and complete authority in its discretion to determine, among other things, the persons to whom, and the time or times in which, stock options shall be granted, the number of shares to be covered by each option granted and the period of time and
requisite conditions for each; and to determine the terms and provisions of the option agreements (which agreements need not be identical).</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Committee may, in its discretion,
delegate its general administrative duties to an officer or employee or committee composed of officers or employees of the Company, but may not delegate its authority to construe and interpret the plan or approve the granting of stock
options.</font></p> <p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Committee may at any time or from time to time amend the Plan in any respect without restriction and without the consent of any participant. However, any

as to the legal right of any beneficiary to exercise any rights under the Plan, the rights to the option in question may be exercised by the estate of the participant, in which event the Company shall have no further liability to anyone with respect
