Executive in which the Executive is participating at the time of a Change of
Control (or programs providing the Executive with at least substantially
similar benefits) other than as a result of the normal expiration of any such
employee benefit program in accordance with its terms as in effect at the time
of a Change of Control, or taking of any action, or the failure to act, by the
Corporation which would adversely affect the executive's continued
participation in any of such employee benefit programs on at least as
favourable a basis to the Executive as is the case&nbsp; on the date of a Change of Control; or which
would materially reduce the Executive's benefits in the future under any of
such employee benefit programs or deprive him of any material benefit enjoyed
by the Executive at the time of a Change of Control;</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 40">(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a material breach by the

Financial Officer or the Chief Legal Officer in the event of any Change of
Control referred to in any of paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 (inclusive) above.</p>

Executive to attempt to substantially perform his or her duties and
responsibilities with regard to the Corporation or any affiliate (other than
any such failure resulting from the Executive's incapacity due to physical or
mental illness of any such actual or anticipated failure by the Executive for
Good Reason, as defined in paragraph 3.2) after demand for substantial
performance is delivered by the Corporation that specifically identifies the
manner in which the Corporation believes the Executive has failed to attempt to
substantially perform his or her duties and responsibilities and a reasonable
time for the Executive to correct or remedy;</p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 40">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the

misappropriation or fraud with regard to the Corporation or any of the assets
of the Corporation (other than good faith expense account disputes).</p>



<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20">For purposes of
this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on the Executive's part shall be
considered &quot;willful&quot; unless done or omitted to be done, by him or her not in
good faith and without reasonable belief that his or her action or omission was
in the best interests of the Corporation. In the event that the Executive
alleges that the failure to attempt to perform his or her duties and
responsibilities is due to a physical or mental illness, and thus not &quot;Cause&quot;
under paragraph 3.3, the Executive shall be required to furnish the Corporation
with a written statement from a licensed physician who is reasonably acceptable
to the Corporation which confirms the Executive's inability to attempt to
perform due to such physical or mental illness. A termination for Cause after a
Change of Control shall be based only on events occurring after such Change of
Control; provided, however, the foregoing limitation shall not apply to an
event constituting Cause which was not discovered by the Corporation prior to a
Change of Control.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent: -35; margin-left: 35">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Date of Termination</u>.&nbsp; &quot;Date of Termination&quot;, with respect to any
purported termination of the Executive's employment after a Change of Control,

Corporation, the Date of Termination shall not be less than thirty (30) days
after the Change of Control except in the case of a termination for Cause which
shall be the date specified in the Notice of Termination.&nbsp; In the case of a termination by the Executive
for Good Reason, the Date of Termination shall not be earlier than 90 days
after the Change of Control. In the event of Notice of Termination by the
Corporation, the Executive may treat such notice as having a date of
termination at any date between the date of the receipt of such notice and the
date of termination indicated in the Notice of Termination by the Corporation;
provided, that the Executive must give the Corporation written notice of the
Date of Termination if he or she deems it to have occurred prior to the Date of
Termination indicated in the notice.</p>

required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any
amounts payable to the Executive by the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement.
Further, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement
shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive or benefit
provided to the Executive as the result of employment by another employer or
otherwise. Except as otherwise provided herein and apart from any disagreement
between the Executive and the Corporation concerning interpretation of this
Agreement or any term or provision hereof, the Corporation's obligations to
make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its
obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including
without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which the Corporation may have against the Executive.</p>

obligation hereunder shall be solely that of the Corporation. A Change of
Control, however, as used in this Agreement, shall refer only to a Change of
Control of Alcan Inc. </p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20">9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without prejudice to any
other confidentiality undertakings or obligations by which the Executive may be
bound in favor of the Corporation, the Executive shall not at any time during
the term of this Agreement, or thereafter, directly or indirectly, for any
reason whatsoever, communicate or disclose to any unauthorized person, firm or
corporation, or use for the Executive's own account, without the prior written
consent of the Board of Directors, any proprietary processes, trade secrets or
other confidential data or information of the Corporation and its related and affiliated
companies concerning their businesses or affairs, accounts, products, services
or customers, it being understood, however, that the obligations set forth in
this Section shall not apply to the extent that the aforesaid matters (i) are
disclosed in circumstances in which the Executive is legally required to do so,
or (ii) become known to and available for use by the public other than by the
Executive's wrongful act or omission.</p>



<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 20">9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control, any non-competition agreement between the Corporation and
the Executive shall be considered null and void.&nbsp; For the purposes of this Agreement, a
non-competition agreement shall include, without limitation, any provision
restricting the Executive's freedom to seek or obtain employment or invest in
or advise any corporation or business.</p>

successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, amalgamation, merger,
arrangement, reorganization, consolidation or otherwise) to all or
substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Corporation to expressly
assume and agree in writing to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to
the same extent that the Corporation would be required to perform it if no such
succession had taken place. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors and heirs. If the Executive shall die after
termination of his employment while any amount would still be payable to the
Executive hereunder if the Executive had continued to live, all such amounts,
unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement to the executors, personal representatives or administrators of
the Executive's estate. This Agreement is personal to the Executive and neither
this Agreement nor any rights hereunder may be assigned by the Executive.</p>

No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged
unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing and
signed by the Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by
the Board of Directors. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or
conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement and
the Employment Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof. No agreements or
representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the
subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly
set forth in this Agreement or the Employment Agreement. All references to any
